Abstract: This action funds William Lake Carter of Virginia Tech to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. The project title is "Use of Surface Wave Tests for Evaluating the Efficacy of Ground Improvement Techniques for Mitigating the Risk from Earthquake Induced Liquefaction." The host scientist is Dr. Brendon Bradley.<br/><br/>After the devastating 2010-2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence, the city of Christchurch, New Zealand is in a state of rebuilding. A particular focus is on mitigating future risk of damage from earthquake induced liquefaction at proposed building sites. Ground improvement technologies, like stone columns, reduce soil liquefaction potential by increasing the density and lateral effective confinement of the soil profile. However, the installation technique for stone columns is non-standardized and varies from company to company; stone columns installed by one technique may have a lower liquefaction potential than sites where stone columns were installed using another technique. This research determines the effectiveness of ground improvement techniques and their installation techniques by evaluating the improved sites using surface wave tests. Using Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) equipment, the PI performs active source, shear wave profiling of various improved ground sites around Christchurch and its environs. The tests are performed at the improved ground sites and adjacent unimproved ground sites to provide a comparison. Both sets of measurements are transformed into one-dimensional shear wave profiles and subsequently, compared to quantify the soil improvement defined by an increase in shear wave velocity across the site; an increase in shear wave velocity constitutes an increase in soil stiffness and resistance against soil liquefaction. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the proposed research will continue to cultivate the professional and academic relationship between the University of Canterbury and Virginia Tech. It is also hoped that both research groups will learn from each other and further the profession's knowledge of earthquake risk mitigation worldwide. Stemming from this research will be an MS thesis, which will document the findings of this unique study. It is expected that the findings from this research will be shared with the earthquake engineering community by publishing the results in a high quality journal and/or a conference proceedings.

Abstract: This action funds Laramie Paige Jameson of Texas Christian University to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan. The project title is "Ionic Liquids in Micelles: Controlling the Conformation of Small Molecules." The host scientist is Professor Noriho Kamiya. <br/><br/>The Intellectual Merit of the research project is the advance of an underdeveloped, yet potentially useful paradigm regarding the ability of ionic liquids to control chemical, physical and structural properties of small molecules by simply placing them structurally similar, yet distinct (in regard to physical properties) solvents. Recent work suggests that adjusting the aggregation state of ionic liquids can modulate the conformational equilibrium of small molecules. The aggregation state of ionic liquids appears to depend on the structure of the cationic and anionic counterparts. This project tests the hypothesis that the aggregation state of ionic liquids can be altered by the incorporation of ionic liquids into a confined environment (such as reverse micelles). Thus, the research evaluates the ability of ionic liquids in reverse micelles to modulate the conformation of small molecules and compares it to the neat ionic liquids. It is anticipated that the results of the proposed research might be applicable for the design of electronic devices, sensors, nanoreactors, as well as novel membranes and drug delivery systems. Overall, this research is likely to have impacts on the fields of ionic liquids and spectroscopy, as well as synthetic and materials chemistry, and biotechnology.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Chase W. Nelson of the University of South Carolina-Columbia to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at the Genomics Research Center of Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. The project title is "The Genetic Basis of Gene Expression Divergence between Rice and Maize: Uncovering the Evolutionary Origin of C4 Photosynthesis." The host scientist is Dr. Wen-Hsiung Li.<br/><br/>This project undertakes a bioinformatics analysis of genomic and transcriptomic next-generation sequencing data from rice (Oryza sativa, a model C3 photosynthesizing plant) and maize (Zea mays, a model C4 plant). Previous work in the Li lab has revealed important gene expression differences between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of maize. These results are being expanded through an evolutionary analysis of the genetic basis of gene expression divergence between maize and rice leaves at early developmental stages. The analysis examines developmental transcription factor (TF) genes to determine whether gene expression differences mainly result from cis or trans effects. Results address the hypothesis that TF genes exhibiting differential expression between these species play important roles in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, an important issue in plant physiology. By facilitating international collaboration, this research will allow the tailoring of new computational techniques to the various methods used in data generation.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Furthermore, the Fellow's project will achieve several unique broader impacts. The cultural and scientific experiences gained in Taipei will contribute to his role as the BioInvestigations Lab Coordinator at the EdVenture Children's Museum in Columbia, SC where his duties include informal science education and training staff in basic molecular biology techniques. Results will be presented at both Academia Sinica and the University of South Carolina, and also submitted for publication in a plant physiology journal.

Abstract: This action funds Jocelyn M.

The project title is "Measuring the Turnover of Black Carbon in Soil Using Hydrogen Pyrolysis." The host scientist is Dr. Michael I. Bird.<br/><br/>Black carbon, also known as charcoal or pyrogenic carbon, is broadly defined as the carbon-rich residue left after incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. It is commonly found in soils, and there is evidence that it turns over very slowly (over hundreds of years to millennia). Incorporation of carbon into charcoal may be an important mechanism of carbon stabilization in soils, but little is known about what factors control its turnover. This project uses a promising new technique called hydrogen pyrolysis to study charcoal carbon in soils. Hydrogen pyrolysis is combined with elemental analysis and mass spectrometry to measure the carbon abundance and isotopic signature of charcoal, which is used to calculate turnover times. The aim is to relate the turnover time of charcoal carbon to environmental variables such as climate, dominant vegetation, and management.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

The project title is "Usage-Based Factors for Vowel Change in New Zealand English." The host scientist is Elizabeth Hume.<br/><br/>This project uses data from a large historical speech corpus hosted at the University of Canterbury to study causes for vowel change in New Zealand English. The corpus is being evaluated for the contribution of usage variables, such as word predictability, the probabilities of different vowel types, and the salience of near-homophones, to vowel centralization and the front vowel shift in New Zealand English. These factors have been shown to influence vowel articulation in everyday speech, and so the goal is to assess whether they may also have influenced the long-term vowel changes in progress, or whether the changes are better accounted for by sociolinguistic analysis. The project contributes to scholarship on vowel system typology, phonetic category maintenance, and the phonetics and phonology of New Zealand English over the last century.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this research promotes the exchange of work being done on the sound systems of global Englishes, including among the multi-disciplinary, international linguistics and cognition researchers at the New Zealand Institute of Language, Brain, and Behavior. The results of the research will contribute to the Origins of New Zealand English Project at the Institute, and will be shared with the wider linguistics community.

Abstract: This action funds Justin Havird of Auburn University to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at The University of the Ryukyus in Okinawa, Japan. The project title is "Molecular Mechanisms of Salt Balance in Unusual Japanese Shrimps." The host scientists are Drs. Yoshihisa Fujita and Michio Hidaka.<br/><br/>The molecular mechanisms of ionic/salt regulation in crustaceans (i.e., osmoregulation) have only been characterized for a narrow range of species, mainly decapod crabs with a marine ancestry. Atyid shrimps from anchialine habitats (coastal ponds and pools) represent an opportunity to address this lack of knowledge since they have a decisively freshwater ancestry but have adapted to live in these "extreme" environments characterized by drastically fluctuating salinities. Previous research found that the Hawaiian endemic atyid Halocaridina rubra has atypical patterns of gene expression following salinity transfer. Specifically, genes typically and dramatically up-regulated (~100 fold) during salinity transfer in other crustaceans do not change significantly in H. rubra. However, no published studies have examined the molecular mechanisms of osmoregulation or functional evolution of anchialine shrimp species. To examine this in an evolutionary context, the molecular mechanisms of osmoregulation from additional anchialine shrimp species from the Ryukyus Islands, Japan are being investigated using high-throughput measures of gene expression (RNA-Seq). These shrimp species represent independent invasions of anchialine habitats (from both freshwater and marine environments) and characterizing their mechanisms of osmoregulation will thus further our limited understanding of the molecular basis of euryhalinity and address convergent evolution in response to similar natural selection pressures. This project illuminates the evolution of osmoregulation, a critical biological process for all living organisms.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, undergraduates from underrepresented groups in the sciences are being trained and mentored during this project. Additionally, this project is fostering research collaborations between scientists at Auburn University and Oregon State University in conjunction with a recent NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DEB 1311500) to the Fellow. The experiences gained from this EAPSI fellowship will be presented to students at Auburn University in an attempt to raise local awareness about international research collaborations in general and the opportunities associated with an EAPSI fellowship specifically. Lastly, anchialine habitats and organisms are being used to engage K-12 students in a variety of biological concepts, building on a current anchialine module in the outreach program Alabama Science in Motion.

Abstract: This action funds Carson J.

The project title is "Programming Simple Molecules to Self-Assemble into Well-Defined Nanoparticles with Intricate Hierarchical Architectures." The host scientist is Professor Makoto Fujita.<br/><br/>The 'bottom-up' strategies to nanotechnology, which carry the banners of self-assembly, supramolecular chemistry, and molecular nanotechnology, are often highly sensitive to experimental conditions or limited by serendipitous discovery. Scientific breakthroughs in this field will be marked by research that describes ways to self-assemble increasingly intricate nano-objects in a more rational, predictable, robust, and well-defined manner. Toward this end, the award supports the development of self-assembled metallo-organic molecular nanoparticles known as M12L24 spheres (where M is a metal ion and L is an organic ligand) to serve as a platform around which to orchestrate the hierarchical self-assembly of more complex molecular architectures. This goal is realized by installing functional groups on the ligands that have the capacity for molecular recognition, which allow them to participate in multiple compatible modes of self-assembly that span a spectrum of strengths and length scales, and include the self-assembly of 'molecular machine' prototypes such as mechanically interlocked molecules known as catenanes, rotaxanes, and pseudorotaxanes. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Furthermore, the Fellow disseminates and enhances scientific understanding to a broad audience by sharing the EAPSI experience at international research conferences and at collaborating national laboratories in both Japan and the United States. The Fellow will extend the benefits of this international research experience to younger students by mentoring undergraduates in related research at the host institution.

Abstract: This action funds William Lennon of the University of California, San Diego to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the University of Electro-Communications in Tokyo, Japan. The project title is "Computational Modeling of the Cerebellum with Additional Biological Realism." The host scientists are Professors Nobito Yamamoto and Tadashi Yamazaki.<br/><br/>While much is known about the anatomy and physiology of the cerebellum, the function of this brain structure remains vague. Roughly speaking, the cerebellum is responsible for ensuring the precise timing and coordination of movement, and is hypothesized to have similar effects on cognition. Computational modeling of the cerebellum has been underway for many decades and has aided researchers in testing hypotheses about its function that would otherwise be impossible in a laboratory setting. Recently, neuroscientists have realized the importance of a particular cell type in the cerebellum, the molecular layer interneuron (MLI). Historically, these cell types have received relatively little attention from neuroscientists and as a result are poorly understood. This project investigates the role of MLIs in a computational model of the cerebellum. In particular, this project investigates the role of learning at synapses formed by MLIs and their effect on learning and control of movement. A better understanding of brain structures like the cerebellum will ultimately guide our understanding of neurological disorders like schizophrenia and autism that are believed to affect these structures. Additional insight into the function of the cerebellum may also lead to novel algorithms in robotics and the control of prosthetic devices. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Furthermore, the PI plans to disseminate the results of this study by publication in peer-reviewed journals, publication of the source code in publicly available databases, and as course material for teaching future students of computational neuroscience.

Abstract: This action funds Katie May Laumann of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, College of William and Mary to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at the Natural History Museum & Institute in Chiba, Japan. The project title is "Using Genetics to Build a Sturgeon Family Tree: More Data is Better." The host scientist is Dr. Masaki Miya. <br/><br/>Understanding relationships among different species is important on many levels, but reliably elucidating these relationships requires significant amounts of data. Sturgeons are economically and culturally important, in addition to representing an ancient lineage of fishes. However, recent studies of relationships among the approximately 25 species of sturgeons have been limited in the amount of data available. This has led to conflicting family trees, with little resolution or agreement among researchers on the details of relationships among species. This study aims to resolve differences among the various proposed sturgeon family trees, and does so by using more genetic data than has previously been available. This project uses laboratory techniques to obtain genetic sequences of the full mitochondrial DNA (unit of DNA inherited only from the mother) for individuals of each sturgeon species. Similarities among sequences of different species are used to identify which species are most closely related to one another, resulting in a sturgeon family tree built from the largest data set available to date. This study provides new information about relationships among sturgeon species. Building a reliable sturgeon family tree is especially important because every sturgeon species is endangered, threatened, or requires protection. Although we know that habitat damage and overfishing of sturgeons have contributed to major population declines in these fishes, information about relationships among sturgeons can help identify more specific factors contributing to declines.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, managers will be able to use this information to mitigate contributing factors and to aid in the recovery of those populations that are most threatened. This will aid in the conservation of species that are not only ecologically important, but economically and culturally important. Sturgeons produce the finest caviar, and support the caviar industry and all of the people whose livelihoods depend upon it. Additionally, sturgeons have been traditionally important to Native American and First Nations people, and are therefore of great cultural significance. This study will ultimately ensure that these fishes and the industries and cultures that value them are preserved.

Abstract: This action funds Sarah Tynen of University of Colorado to conduct a research project in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Nanjing University in Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. The project title is "(In)Visible Boundaries: Socioeconomic Identity in the Urban Landscape of China." The host scientist is Professor Wang Hongyang.<br/><br/>Variegated types of neighborhood governance and markedly differentiated urban landscapes are growing trends that geographically separate the lower, middle, and upper classes in China. In this way, striking differences in the landscape between low-income and high-income neighborhoods mark visible and invisible boundaries in the built and social environments. The study takes a spatial science approach to examining urban redevelopment using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) combined with ethnographic research methods in order to most appropriately address the uneven geographies of housing development. For the GIS analysis, the project combines an analysis of land-use change with a study of urban zoning, neighborhood, and demographic data layers to examine socioeconomic segregation. The ethnographic research methods, especially semi-structured interviews, explore how the urban landscape exacerbates class insecurity and reinforces residents' efforts to establish socio-spatial identity. This research examines the popular rhetoric that justifies social stratification through the personal narratives and experiences of gated community and dilapidated neighborhood residents. The research is based on the hypothesis that the inclusion and exclusion of residents are created by interactions among many actors, not as a unidirectional process between individuals but instead on multiscalar institutional and societal levels. The intellectual merit of this research is significant in advancing the conventional boundary studies found in political geography by looking at the contradictions between various actors in the construction of class and social boundaries on a local level as reflected in the urban landscape.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the broader impacts of the proposed research include promoting increased knowledge of the connection between economic development and inter-group tensions on a local scale. The research is contextualized in the broader global processes of increased mobility of capital to engage with debates that address questions of political economy in a world with increased globalization. This is relevant to both urban U.S. and urban China, where the research will build on the existing literature on economic development in the contestation between social classes for urban space. Chinese urban development is following the American model of the entrepreneurial city, but China's unique regulatory climate of political economy creates a built environment that is not yet fully understood. By addressing questions of segregation, economic development, and identity formation on the local scale in urban China, the research contributes to a broader academic understanding of the impacts of income inequality and uneven spatial development. The broader impacts of this research therefore illuminate the effect of institutionalized development efforts to simultaneously regulate and deregulate various urban spaces based on social status and household income. Furthermore, the research will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.

Abstract: This action funds Page Quinton of The University of Missouri to conduct a research project in Geoscience during the summer of 2013 at the Geological Survey of New South Wales in Sydney. The project title is "Constraining Global Sea Surface Temperatures Trends during the Late Ordovician Period in New South Wales Australia." The host scientist is Dr. Ian Percival.<br/><br/>This project establishes the first high-resolution sea surface temperature record of the Australian continent during the Late Ordovician (a time period from 454 to 443 million years ago) using conodont elements (the teeth-like structures located in the gills of a small marine animal, referred to as conodonts) collected from New South Wales, Australia. Previous work along these lines has largely been conducted on rocks from North America making it difficult to determine if observed patterns were global or regional. These results have implications for the role atmospheric carbon dioxide on climate evolution, the timing of Ordovician glaciation, and the relationship between glaciation and the mass extinction event at the end of the Ordovician Period. Furthermore, knowledge of the global climate has societal relevance. Mechanism which governed past changes in global climate, continue to do so today. A better understanding of them will contribute to better predictions of possible changes going forward especially on a long time scale.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Stephanie Lynn Fiorenza of CUNY Graduate Center to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Nagoya University in Nagoya, Chubu, Japan. The project title is "Infrared-Bright Galaxies: The Connection Between Starbursts and Active Galactic Nuclei." The host scientist is Tsutomu T. Takeuchi.<br/><br/>The evolutionary connection between nuclear starbursts and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), which form from galaxy interactions and produce the bulk of their radiation as infrared (IR) emission, is not well understood. To this effort, this project examines 12 U/LIRGs within the IRAS 2 Jy Redshift Survey. This project classifies the primary source of IR radiation as being a nuclear starburst or a type of AGN by using key emission line ratios and then performs spectral decompositions on IR spectra to quantify the contributions of the starbursts and/or AGN to their host galaxies' IR luminosity (LIR). Finally, this project uses the CIGALE (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission) to measure starburst ages. Comparing the starburst ages with the IR-power source classifications and starburst/AGN contributions reveals which type of IR-power source forms first and how starburst age varies with starburst/AGN strength in U/LIRGs. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. The Fellow is the first doctoral astrophysics student in at least two decades to be enrolled at the City University of New York (CUNY), an urban minority-serving institution, and she hopes to help expand the program by encouraging others, including students in Japan, to enroll as doctoral students in astrophysics. Furthermore, the Fellow is a co-chair of CUNY Women in STEM, and will promote careers in science and technology to women by sharing her experience as an EAPSI participant at STEM-sponsored events. Finally, the Fellow will use the EAPSI experience to inform work teaching a college-leel astronomy course for Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth Summer Programs.

Abstract: This action funds Paul Piula Taele of Texas A&M University to conduct a research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at Singapore Management University in the Republic of Singapore. The project title is "Improving Computer Applications for Creative Design using Natural Gesture Input." The host scientist is Dr. Richard C. Davis.<br/><br/>Advances in human-computer interaction and artificial intelligent research enable people to interact naturally with computers through gestures using their limbs instead of through computer peripherals such as keyboard and mouse. People already use interactions from the gestures expressed with their limbs to convey ideas, information, and emotional responses, and such interactions also have great potential in expanding creative design from the virtual into the physical world. Unfortunately, such interactions are also largely untapped by existing creative design computer applications, which focus prematurely on design content instead of on valuable early-stage raw design planning. This research therefore actively explores successful techniques to combine advances of natural gesture interactions in computer applications with the potential of producing powerful creative design in the physical world. The core tasks of this research include surveying target users for proposed ideas and features, developing improvements to the existing code base of approaches, deploying the research system to target users, observing those users' interaction with the system, and collecting qualitative and quantitative feedback following extended trials of users' interactions with the system.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, these aims are directly supporting techniques for advancing discovery and understanding in novel interactive environments by actively focusing on enhancing the creative design process--for example, communicating ideas more clearly, summarizing information more accurately, or provoking emotional responses. Since such tools are also highly applicable for promoting teaching and training, the Fellow is working with teachers and trainers on introducing these additional resources in instructional content design, encouragingucational activities tht offer students engaging design projects in novel interactive environments.

Mizuhito Ogawa and Keita Yokoyama.<br/><br/>This project extends current research in the area of Reverse Mathematics regarding combinatorial principles and specifically Ramsey's Theory for pairs. In general, Reverse Mathematics is a program which focuses on classifying the proof-theoretic strength of mathematical theorems from all area of mathematics as subsystems of second-order arithmetic; interestingly it is the case that a large number of theorems fall into one of five major such subsystems known as "the big five", however many of the known exceptions to this are combinatorial principles - the goal is to advance what is known about Ramsey's Theory for pairs. Dr. Yokoyama has had significant success in this area before using model theoretic methods, in particular relating to approaches used in non-standard analysis, so this research begins work with these techniques in mind as well as considering proof-theoretic and recursion-theoretic methods in the work.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Lindsey Furman Dougherty of the University of California Berkeley to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the Queensland Brain Institute and University of Queensland (UQ) in Brisbane, Australia. The project title is "Mechanisms, Ultrastructure and Behavioral Function of Flashing in Ctenoides Ales: Disco Clams.'" The host scientist is Dr. Justin Marshall. <br/><br/>The ocean's euphotic zone is an environment in which light is extremely variable, yet a wide array of organisms use visual displays that require ambient light for reflection. The bivalve mollusk Ctenoides ales lives at depths up to 20m and often inside crevices, where ambient light is dim and wavelength-restricted. Despite its light-limited habitat, this species evolved a reflective mantle edge that emits vivid light, leading to its common name, disco clam. C. ales is the only known bivalve with a behaviorally controlled photic display, yet virtually nothing is known about its mechanism, function or life history. Preliminary research in transmission electron microscopy, high speed video, spectrometry, hyperspectral imaging and particle modeling have advanced intracellular and mechanistic understanding of how the photic display is produced, but its behavioral purpose remains unknown. During this field season, hypotheses about the function of the flashing are being tested, including that it acts to attract phototaxic prey, larval juveniles for settlement, or is an aposematic warning toward predators. The study of photic displays by organisms advances knowledge about visual systems, communication, physical optics, photonics, structural composition and biomimetic technology.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, undergraduate students at Berkeley and at UQ are helping with research and field studies, allowing insight into graduate-level work and collaboration. Research results are being disseminated through the Understanding Science website of the University of California Museum of Paleontology. Project updates, photographs and videos are being uploaded through a blog. As these bivalves are well known in aquariums and popular with the public, there is substantial interest in this project. This project is also being communicated through involvement with WIS (Women in Science) by examining the role of women in Australian scientific communities. Finally, the results are being communicated through community involvement in the Dinner With A Scientist program at the Oakland Zoo; Science Nights at multiple local elementary schools; and through volunteer efforts with the Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) Conference which targets girls in middle school, the Surfrider Foundation and SurfAid. This research and outreach are forging partnerships between the international community, UQ, and Berkeley.

Abstract: This action funds Steven Thomas Callen of Saint Louis University to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the Kunming Institute of Botany in Kunming, Yunnan, China. The project title is "A comparative analysis of floral reproductive traits between native and introduced kudzu (Pueraria montana)." The host scientist is Dr. Hong Wang.<br/><br/>The ability of invasive plant species to reproduce in new environments may be limited by the availability of compatible mates and pollinators. In such situations, shifts in plant mating systems (for example, from outcrossing to self-fertilization) may promote invasion by providing enhanced fruit and seed production. Current understanding of mating system shifts during invasion is limited, particularly for perennial (long-lived) invaders that reproduce both sexually and clonally. In this study, the Fellow uses the vine kudzu (Pueraria montana), one of the most potent plant invaders in North America, as a model to investigate the consequences of invasion for the mating systems of perennial, clonal plants. The reproductive biology (pollinator and pollen availability and its capacity for fruit/seed set and self-fertilization) from its native range (China) to that from its introduced range (North America) are compared.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this study supplements other comparative studies of plant invasions among China and North America to identify common factors driving invasion success between the two countries. Photos and videos will be integrated with the knowledge and results generated from this fellowship for presentations at national and international scientific meetings, reports for conservation organizations, and teaching activities. Establishing international collaborations allows the Fellow to connect undergraduate and high school students with Chinese researchers through video conferencing, helping to expand student concepts of scientific research to a global view.

Abstract: This action funds Matthew Holliday of the University of Arizona to conduct a research project in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at the University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand. The project title is "Classroom Expectations: The Relationship between Teacher Beliefs and Student Achievement." The host scientist is Dr. Christine Rubie-Davies.<br/><br/>Many studies have explored the relationship between classroom teacher expectations of their students' academic abilities and the differential learning outcomes that result from these expectations. Unfortunately, teacher expectations often serve as self-fulfilling prophecies; teachers tend to dedicate more of their instructional energy towards their perceived academically stronger students while neglecting those for whom they have lower expectations. However, less is known about the impact of teaching beliefs (e.g., whether teachers believe they can help improve students math scores or foster creativity) and perception of classroom climate (i.e., the context in which student and instructor interact) in relation to students' academic achievement. This project uses a secondary dataset to examine the interplay between teacher expectations, beliefs, motivation, and classroom climate perceptions in relation to student academic achievement as measured by student scores on the mathematics portion of a nationally administered standardized test. Data were collected from March through October 2012 and included 60 middle school teachers and their approximately 2,000 students in Auckland, New Zealand. With respect to New Zealand, the researchers are also interested in discovering if there are varying teacher expectations of the under-represented Mori and Pacific Islander students, and whether these potential differences relate to (1) teacher motivation and beliefs about teaching and (2) this subgroup's academic achievement as measured by their mathematics exam score.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this study contributes to the promotion of teaching, training, and learning. Findings will help guide the development of teacher training programs and advance educational policy reform, as well as provide researchers and practitioners across interdisciplinary fields with insight on the effects of expectations and self-fulfilling prophecies. The Fellow will disseminate the findings widely in order to enhance the understanding of the relevance of expectancy theory in disciplines beyond psychology. The Fellow intends to report the results through diverse forms of multimedia, such as pamphlets, TV interviews, and websites, in order to reach the parents, teachers, students, and researchers who are not accustomed to reading educational psychology research publications.

Abstract: This action funds Evan Thomas of Virginia Tech to conduct a research project in Geosciences during the summer of 2013 at the University of Electro-Communications in Chfu, Tokyo. The project title is "Dynamics of Ionospheric Plasma Irregularities as Measured by Global Positioning System (GPS) Receivers and the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN)." The host scientist is Dr. Keisuke Hosokawa.<br/><br/>Many critical technologies relied upon by both commercial and military users around the world are directly impacted by events occurring in the charged component of Earth's upper atmosphere, known as the ionosphere. Strong geomagnetic storms are responsible for causing ionospheric clutter in over-the-horizon radar systems; degradation of GPS signals (scintillations); and induced electrical currents in power distribution networks. This project analyzes simultaneous ionospheric total electron content (TEC) observations of plasma structures with data collected from SuperDARN space weather radars for two main purposes. The first objective is to examine the extent to which small-scale plasma irregularities occur in the gradients of large-scale ionospheric features such as subauroral polarization stream (SAPS), storm enhanced density (SED), and tongue of ionization (TOI). The second objective is to gain a better understanding of the methods used to study travelling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) with the dense networks of instrumentation in Japan and apply them to the similarly well-covered North American sector.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this project plays an important role in forging new collaborative research activities between the Japanese and American space science communities as we continue to expand the global mapping capabilities of GPS networks and SuperDARN. The scientific findings achieved as a result of this project will be presented at scientific meetings and then submitted for publication to appropriate peer-reviewed journals. Upon return to the United States, a presentation will be made to the students and faculty of the Space@VT department describing the Fellow's experiences in the program.

Abstract: -----<br/><br/>This action funds Johanna M. Nevitt of Stanford University to conduct a research project in the Geosciences area during the summer of 2013 at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. The project title is "Improving Numerical Models of Fault Deformation at the Crustal Scale." The host scientist is Dr. Virginia G. Toy. <br/><br/>Numerical models of fault-related deformation are built upon a number of physical equations, including constitutive equations that define how rock deforms in response to stress. Implementing accurate constitutive equations is essential to producing significant and reliable model results. Rocks located within fault-zones may creep (i.e., deform viscously) in either a grain size sensitive (GSS) or grain size insensitive (GSI) manner, which is believed to result in either aseismic (steady-state) slip or seismic (earthquake-producing) slip on faults, respectively. Constitutive equations for GSS and GSI creep are currently poorly constrained, which limits our ability to model fault-related deformation, particularly at the crustal scale. This project determines appropriate constants for GSS and GSI creep constitutive equations by analyzing samples collected by scientific drilling into New Zealand?s Alpine Fault Zone. Microchemical and microstructural maps, created using energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis of the samples, reveal whether deformation occurred via GSS or GSI creep. The maps can then be imported into Elle, a modeling platform for simulating the two-dimensional evolution of microstructures in a polycrystalline material during and following deformation. Numerical experiments are conducted in Elle to determine the constants for the creep constitutive equations that best simulate the fabrics observed in the samples. Dr. Toy will eventually use these parameterized constitutive equations in crustal scale numerical models of the earthquake cycle on the Alpine Fault. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Upon returning to the U.S., the fellow will share what she learned with current and future users of Stanford's EBSD lab by creating a quartz-specific EBSD manual and leading a seminar on strategies specific to analyzing and modeling quartz deformation. This will be valuable, since no faculty members at Stanford are currently using EBSD analysis or numerical methods to study quartz deformation. In addition, the fellow will share her experience studying the Alpine Fault in New Zealand through "Geokids," a Stanford University outreach program that teaches basic earth science to elementary school children. In a more formal sense, the results of this project will be disseminated at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in San Francisco in December 2013, and will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Abstract: --------<br/>This action funds Daniel Thomas of the University of Oregon to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at the laboratory of Dr. Yu-Ming Ju at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. The project title is "Exploring a New Dimension of Plant Health: Benign and Beneficial Fungi in Living Woody Plants." The host scientist is Dr. Yu-Ming Ju. <br/><br/>This research investigates the diversity of wood-inhabiting fungal endophytes in trees in the cloud forests of Taiwan. To do so, direct Polymerase Chain Reaction methods are adapted for use on wood-inhabiting fungal endophytes using genetic barcodes to estimate the species richness in wood of members of Xylariaceae. The ecological links between termites and Xylaria endophytes in the cloud forest are also being investigated, and preliminary experiments on methods of foliar inoculation with Xylaria spores are being conducted. This work will increase our knowledge of fungal endophytes, which are found in every plant ever sampled, including all human food plants. Endophytes represent a fast-evolving, quickly and widely dispersing network of micro-organisms that may act as a mitigating influence on plants in the face of disturbance, pathogens, and extreme climate variation. The effects of endophytes are vastly complex and one cannot assume mutalisms; however, it is reasonable to hypothesize that plant health is controlled in much the same way as human health: as the result of complex microbial community interactions. The possible consequences for tropical forestry and agriculture are significant. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the results of this research will be disseminated at agricultural industry conferences and made available to interested government land management and agricultural agencies both in the United States, Taiwan, and to pertinent academic journals.

Abstract: This action funds Meghan Marie Cromie of Texas Tech University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at Nanjing Medical University in Nanjing, China. The project title is "Determination of Persistent Organic Pollutants in Township Waters of China and Their Ecological Impact." The host scientist is Dr. Shou-Lin Wang, M.D., Ph.D.<br/><br/>With a growing population and a heavy reliance on industry and agriculture, China has experienced an increase in the concentration of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) being released into surface waters, specifically in townships located in Eastern China near Nanjing. With higher cancer incidences near this region, it is this project's hope to identify and quantify the POPs responsible for this problem. This study aims to address these research gaps by determining POPs and identify possible sources of contamination throughout the region using different approaches, including biological and chemical techniques. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the Fellow intends on mentoring and training a female, senior undergraduate student from the University. Through mentoring, the Fellow will provide training that will prepare a student to eventually carry out her own independent research, which will hopefully build on data collected over the course of the summer. In addition, the time in China will be used to present the Fellow's master's and doctoral research projects at the host university, as well as neighboring universities to increase networking and enhance potential international collaborations. The research conducted in China will also be used by the host collaborator's lab for epidemiological studies to determine relationships between contamination sites and townships with increased incidences of cancer. Finally, upon the Fellow's return to the United States, she plans on presenting her research at a conference, publishing with the host collaborator and implementing some of the findings in her dissertation research.

Abstract: This action funds Christopher Ortega of the University of Houston to conduct a research project in materials science during the summer of 2013 at Yunnan University in Kunming, Yunnan. The project title is "The Synthesis and Characterization of a Nanostructured Composite Photoanode used for Solar Assisted Hydrogen Generation." The host scientist is Dr. Zhu Liu.<br/><br/>This project works toward the synthesis of a composite photoanode consisting of a nano-mesoporous Tungsten Trioxide film, that is electrochemically coated with hematite. The nanoporous Tungsten Trioxide film provides a scaffold for the hematite resulting in a nanoporous network, with an increased surface area that allows for higher efficiency in hydrogen generation. Precise electrochemical pulse deposition is used to coat the nanoporous network of the WO3 film with a highly uniform hematite film. The use of a composite structure, alongside a nanoporous structure allows for a highly efficient photoanode, capable of generating hydrogen when exposed to solar light. This research is novel clean energy research topic since hydrogen is the required fuel for fuel cells, but the majority of hydrogen is currently generated using fossil fuels, making hydrogen fuel cells a non-fully clean energy process. By developing a renewable method of generating hydrogen, it is possible to have a completely renewable energy generation process.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this project allows for both Dr. Zhu Liu and the Fellow to disseminate the results of the research at conferences and workshops in the United States and the host country. This ensures that the research impacts a wider audience in the countries that have the highest need for clean energy. The research conducted will also be shared with the Fellow's home university, through seminars and department presentations showing the benefits of international collaboration, international culture exchange, and the value of clean energy fuel synthesis.

Abstract: This action funds Alissa Mrazek of Northwestern University to conduct a research project in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at the Multicultural Identity and Processes Lab at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The project title is "The Role of the Serotonin Transporter Gene and Cultural Tightness-Looseness in Social Perception and Cooperation." The host scientist is Dr. Ying Yi Hong.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to examine how individual variability in genes that regulate affective processing may interact with one's cultural environment to facilitate or hinder cooperation with ingroup and outgroup members. Specifically, we study how tightness-looseness (TL)--a cultural dimension measuring the strength of social norms and tolerance of deviance--and the serotonin transporter gene influence interpersonal cooperation. Due to the influence of TL on norm abidance and outgroup perceptions, the role of the serotonin transporter gene on threat sensitivity, and research showing that TL and the serotonin transporter gene have evolved in tandem across geography, investigating the dual influence of these factors on a risky undertaking, such as cooperation with outgroup members, sheds light on the complexities that underlie prosocial behavior. Specific to this project, the majority of peer-reviewed studies examining neural and genetic variation come from Western, industrialized nations and do not acknowledge the influence of cultural values on the relation between human brain function and behavior (Chiao, 2009). Hence, the present research aims to address the external validity of both psychological intergroup processes and behavioral genetic paradigms. Additionally, Singaporeans are an underrepresented population in research, so this project will broaden participation in science while illuminating an unexplored gene-environment interaction in two distinct cultures: the United States and Singapore.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, another primary goal of this research is to equip the Fellow with a deeper understanding of the factors that influence prosociality to aid in the preparation of a nuanced intervention-training program to cultivate cooperation. Finally, this research has the potential to be an intellectual bridge between scientific advancement in the Social, Affective, Cultural Neuroscience Lab at Northwestern University and the Multicultural Identity and Processes Lab the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Both of these labs value the dual influence of biology and culture on interpersonal behavior, and this advantageous collaboration will foster future cross-cultural work in the fields of behavioral genetics, social psychology, and cultural neuroscience.

Abstract: This action funds Peter Charles Albert Johnson of Virginia Commonwealth University to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Geothermal, Reservoir Engineering and Environmental Fluids group in the Department of Engineering Science at The University of in Auckland, New Zealand. The project title is "Inverse Computer Modeling of Geothermal Reservoirs." The host scientist is Professor Mike O'Sullivan.<br/><br/>Models of geothermal reservoirs that are used by a geothermal power plant are essential for understanding a reservoir's properties. Determining these properties through inverse methods is vital for managing power plants, and by using a calibrated numerical model of heat and mass flow within a given geothermal reservoir, reservoir properties can be determined. This research investigates uses of software such as PEST (Parameter ESTimation) and iTOUGH2 (Inverse Transport Of Unsaturated Groundwater and Heat 2) to dramatically improve the accuracy of the reservoir models. This has the potential to facilitate the implementation of geothermal power generation in geologically suitable locations across the United States, which can provide continuous base-load electrical power in a sustainable, economical, and carbon reducing manner, especially when compared to electricity generated from fossil-fuel sources. This renewable domestic energy resource will not only lower greenhouse emissions and aide the United States quest for energy independence, but will also reduce the negative impacts of mining for other natural resources such as coal and uranium.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Chad Mangum of North Carolina State University to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Xiamen University in Xiamen, Fujian, China. The project title is "An Alternative Description of Infinite Dimensional Algebras: Representations of Twisted Toroidal Lie Algebras." The host scientist is Dr. Shaobin Tan.<br/><br/>The representation theory of Lie algebras has been a significant area of mathematical research for several decades, particularly that of affine Lie algebras (an infinite dimensional generalization of finite dimensional semisimple Lie algebras). A generalization of affine algebras known as toroidal Lie algebras will be the topic of this research endeavor, in particular the twisted 2-toroidal (a natural generalization of the so-called twisted affine algebras, as opposed to nontwisted). The realization of affine algebras as a one-dimensional universal central extension of a loop algebra is expanded to include Laurent polynomials in 2 variables (hence the term 2-toroidal), with the universal central extension now itself being infinite dimensional. A Drinfeld realization of such algebras (which defines the algebra via generators and relations) will be sought, as well as progress toward both fermionic and bosonic representations of such algebras.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, since the host researcher is an expert in toroidal Lie algebras, the Fellow has the opportunity to begin cultivating an international network of pioneers in the field. The Fellow plans to present the results of this work at a seminar upon returning to the U.S., aiding the dissemination of results into the relevant mathematical and scientific communities. The results themselves are likely to have applications to other areas of mathematics and physics (such as particle physics), which is itself a broader impact. Sharing not only results but also other aspects of the Fellow's EAPSI experience with others will advance the program's goals further by making more scientists aware of them, helping to establish even more broadly the goals of long run international collaborations and globally aware scientists.

Abstract: This action funds Dawn Catherine Sweeney Ruth of the University at Buffalo to conduct a research project in Geosciences during the summer of 2013 at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. The project title is "Relating Rock Chemistry and Earthquake Data to Improve Volcano Monitoring Efforts." The host scientist(s) is Dr. Fidel Costa Rodriguez.<br/><br/>This project assesses if the timing of magma movement is related to the timing of earthquakes and ground deformation that occur prior to an eruption, with the ultimate goal of improving volcano monitoring efforts. The migration of magmas from depth is understood as a key eruption-triggering process. Determining the timing of earthquakes and ground deformation is straightforward as the instruments used record a time stamp at the onset of movement. Olivine crystals collected from the products of an eruption are being used to estimate the timing of actual magma movement. When crystals form, the distribution of elements is set. However, this distribution can be affected by subjecting the crystals to new environmental conditions, such as changing the temperature through magma movement. Since changes in elemental distribution in olivine crystals is well understood, comparison of the observed elemental distributions with computer models can be used to estimate the time elapsed since magma movement. Moreover, if the eruption date is known, the approach provides an estimate of when magma movement occurred. If magma movement can be definitively dated and linked to specific seismic signals, then a more process-based approach to volcanic monitoring will likely improve interpretation of geophysical signals at volcanoes.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Julia M. Moriarty of Virginia Institute of Marine Science, the College of William & Mary to conduct a research project in the Geosciences area during the summer of 2013 at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. The project title is "The Influence of Typhoons on Along-River Sediment Fluxes." The host scientist is Dr. Shuh-Ji Kao.<br/><br/>Understanding changes in the transport of riverine material is crucial for estimating sediment budgets, but particulate fluxes vary widely in response to storms and other disturbances. Taiwan offers a unique opportunity to study these fluxes because of the exceptional historical and ongoing records of river discharge (water and sediment) along its small mountainous rivers, and because the island's sediment yields (riverine sediment discharge divided by watershed area) rank among the world's highest. Analysis of the historical record of daily and hourly river gauge data enables analysis of along-river fluxes during both low-energy periods and typhoons (e.g. 1996: Typhoon Herb; 2004: Typhoons Mindulle and Aere). This project will make measurements along the Jhuoshuei River (previously named the Choshui River) in 2013, including sediment concentration and grain size, in order to supplement the historical data. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Furthermore, the research is being incorporated into an interactive activity to engage visitors at Marine Science Day, an annual open house at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) where attendance annually exceeds 1,500 people. This activity is also being developed into a grade-school lesson plan in collaboration with VIMS Marine Advisory Program educators.

The host scientist is Dr. Kenji Fukumizu.<br/><br/>The problem of understanding intelligence, both biological and artificial, is one of the most important scientific questions today. A current approach to this problem is through the topic of learning, or learning from data. The Fellow's research is in kernel methods with applications to learning theory. More specifically the work investigates a large dimensional theory for kernel methods, which<br/>has had little theoretical attention. In studying high dimensional kernel methods, it is reasonable to consider a series of domains of diverging dimensionality, for which a series of kernels is introduced. Thus this project considers the behavior of the kernel in the limit as both the dimensionality of X and the sample size diverge. In doing so, the spectrum associated to a kernel is studied.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Chen-Ping Yu of Stony Brook University to conduct a research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at Perception and Attention Lab of National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan. The project title is "Modeling Human Visual Attention using Object-based Attention." The host scientist is Dr. Su-Ling Yeh.<br/><br/>This project is developing a visual attention model as measured by shift in gaze, which is based on object-based attention theory and takes object parts (proto-objects) into account in addition to the usual spatial features. Current visual attention models predict where people look next based on salient regions of a scene, such as noticeable objects or just features that are prominent somewhere in the image. This corresponds to spatially-based attention, such that attention is driven by interesting locations in the scene. However, recent work suggests that objects can serve as the attention selection basis, in a way that when a person is already attending at an object, changes that occur on the attending object is noticed faster than the same changes that occur away from the object, albeit the same spatial distances. This object-based attention has not yet been captured in predicting human visual attention, and it is the goal for this project to incorporate object-based attention processing with existing spatially-based models in order to predict gaze shift that are more consistent with human behavior. The research model predicts that the shift of eye fixation utilizes the theory of object-based attention, and it requires three major components for processing: objects, the associated object parts (proto-objects), and the saliency map. The top-down object information is being obtained by applying state-of-the-art object detectors in computer vision; proto-objects are being segmented by merging coherent pixel fragments (superpixels) that are similar in low level features; and the saliency map is being generated using multi-scale blob detector on the image, with blob strength denoting the degree of spatial saliency. Initial fixation is set at the most salient region, and whenever an object is selected as being fixated, object-based attention suggests that consequent fixations may prioritize on the associate proto-objects before moving to another spatial salient location, in contrast from existing models that may immediately release from the attending object if other spatial location is deemed more salient. The performance of the eye movement model will be validated against a human fixation dataset using 1000 images from the PASCAL VOC2008 dataset and 104 images from the SUN 2009 dataset. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this project facilitates the learning exchange between the fields of Psychology (human vision) and Computer Science (computer vision). The model can also help and improve visual aids design for the general public, and the underrepresented groups that may require visual representations to be more intuitively perceived. This impact naturally leads to more partnerships between research, education, and the industry, which is all based on the better understanding of human visual attention.

The project title is "Encoding Human Brain Activity Using a Multi-Staged Model of Visual Object Perception." The host scientist is Justin Gardner.<br/><br/>It is easy to take for granted our ability to visually perceive the world. Making sense of the vast amount of information transmitted nearly continuously from our retinae is not a trivial problem: it requires approximately one third of the human cortex to process. Our ability to effortlessly recognize a vast array of objects in tenths of a second, despite being cast on the retina with different illuminations, positions, and rotations, represents the end stage of the so-called ventral pathway. This project contributes to the reverse engineering of object recognition by expanding current prediction and fitting procedures.

Abstract: This action funds Stephanie Tong of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) at National Taiwan University (NTU) in Taipei, Taiwan. The project title is "Model-based Tracking Control Design for Accurate Shake Table Response." The host scientist is Dr. Keh-Chyuan Tsai.<br/><br/>Shake table testing is an effective method for evaluating the response of structures under dynamic loading, particularly earthquake excitations. To take full advantage of shake table testing, tracking control algorithms are applied for more accurate reproduction of earthquake ground accelerations. Realization of an appropriate tracking control algorithm will ensure that the actual shake table response matches the commanded shake table response. The project accomplishes this through the development of a model that captures the dynamics of the system driving the multiple shake table system at the NCREE laboratory and formulating tracking control schemes to ensure robust tracking control. Compensation for tracking error of the system will be provided by feedforward controllers, which control the system through an adjusted command anticipating the system behavior, and feedback controllers, which control the system by correcting the accumulated error. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, appropriate tracking control strategies secured for the NCREE shake table will ultimately advance modern control design by allowing other shake table users to obtain more meaningful testing results for improved structural control methods. The procedure to develop the tracking control will be shared so that perhaps other facilities with similar testing equipment can apply the same concepts in improving their tracking control. Upon return to the home institution, the fellow will give a seminar describing both the scholastic and cultural experience.

The project title is "Comparing Ideological Narratives of Japanese State Formation." The host scientist is Professor Ken'ichi Sasaki.<br/><br/>Archaeological investigations into state formation processes advance not only our understanding of the origin and development of individual nation-states, but also the ideological underpinnings of the global nation-state system. Modern citizens' understanding of their nation's history affects contemporary international politics, and this understanding is largely constructed through presumably objective archaeological research. Due to the difficulty of the Japanese written language, the unavailability of Japanese archaeological research findings abroad, and the restrictive Cultural Protection laws governing archaeological sites, the state of the Japanese archaeology field is extremely difficult for American researchers to ascertain, thus necessitating on-site collaborative research. This project compares the fieldwork practice, site-reports, museum displays, and popular history texts, for their presentation of kofun burial mounds and their relation to the formation of a complex, state-level society in 4-7th centuries CE, with particular attention to the role of ideology in each narrative.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of Japanese archaeological practice in an otherwise restrictive field; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this research will illuminate how scholarly research on the past is re-packaged for popular consumption, with implications for how museum displays are crafted to best engage a viewing public.

Abstract: This action funds Jeffrey McDaniel of University of California, Riverside to conduct a research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan The project title is "Design and Verification Tools for Chips to Automate Biological Experiments." The host scientist is Dr. Tsung-Yi Ho.<br/><br/>This project is developing a top to bottom design automation tool chain for microfluidic bio-chips, which are able to automate biochemical experiments. The tool chain integrates components that have been developed independently at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) and National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. The input to the system is a structured description of the experiment; the tool chain performs the necessary scheduling, placement and routing, and outputs a specification for a chip that can be fabricated using capillary electrophoresis subsystems, which have a broad range of applicability in biochemical assays by separation and detection of unique species. The scheduling of the chip involves binding specific operations to the individual component of the chip which will perform that operation. The components are then placed on the chip, and the channels between the components are routed. The chip is then verified by the tool chain to ensure correctness in accordance to the original experiment. The tool chain, increases the potential for commercial development of low-cost biochips which may supplement, or even replace, traditional benchtop chemistry equipment. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the tool chain brings a standardized format to chip design and assay specification that does not currently exist, allowing for an easier collaboration with other universities. It will facilitate rapid dissemination of biochip designs between laboratories, which will enhance scientific reproducibility of experiments. The Fellow plans to publicly release the tool chain to academia once it reaches a mature and stable state, allowing the wider research community to benefit from its development. UCR is a federally recognized minority serving institution. Under the guidance of the his Ph.D. supervisor, the Fellow he is collaborating with two female undergraduate research assistants and plans to continue mentoring them, along with underrepresented minority students, throughout his Ph.D. studies at UCR.

Abstract: This action funds Andrew Robert Burton of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the Disaster Prevention Research Institute of Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan. The project title is "A Patterned Thin Film Sensor for Damage Detection in Steel Frame Connections." The host scientist is Masayoshi Nakashima.<br/><br/>The destruction caused by recent earthquakes has demanded new methods for performance monitoring of critical infrastructure. Paramount to this goal of post-event damage assessment is reliable, quantitative data for informed structural safety characterizations. This project addresses this challenge through the development of patterned carbon nanotube (CNT) thin film sensors tailored to detect specific failure modes in steel frame connections. These thin film sensors are being created in the Lurie Nanofabrication Facility at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor by patterning CNT-polymer films on parylene substrates using optical lithography and then instrumented through other processes common to microelectromechanical systems. These patterns are being designed for electrical sensitivity that is specific to damage behaviors experienced by steel frame connections under seismic loading. The films are being tested at Kyoto University on a partial-scale steel test frame. They are epoxy bonded to the frame connections and then connected to wireless sensor networks for data acquisition. A large-scale shake table is used to simulate a seismic event on these frames. Data is collected from these sensors during and directly following the event and the sensor signals from each test is being analyzed in relation to the observed structural damage. This project provides two highly-valuable results as CNT thin films will reach a scale necessary for practical civil infrastructure applications and the need for rapid post-seismic damage detection will be addressed.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this project will spark subsequent partnerships facilitating transnational human connections that provide the basic infrastructure for global research. Most immediately this will aid both societies in the shared ambition for increased public safety through performance characterization of critical infrastructure.

Abstract: This action funds Joshua M. Grolman of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to conduct a research project in Biology and Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. The project title is "Nerves on a Chip: Artificial Neuronal Fibers as Model Biological Systems." The host scientist is Professor Injae Shin.<br/><br/>Alginate hydrogels have been widely used as encapsulant materials due to their biocompatibility and ease of forming a gel. However, producing alginate hydrogels in the desired form and function can be impractical, particularly when considering the complicated patterns required for tissue engineering applications. To address these limitations, this work demonstrates a method of forming intricate fibers using a simple micro-scale device and subsequently seeding the constructs with P19 cancer cells. These cell-laden fibers can then be mounted and exposed to retinoic acid to induce change into neural tissue, which may serve as biological models to study White Matter Tracks and neural networks. The implications of a successful biological model of neuronal fibers would be far-reaching, both in treatement applications, as well as a tool for deeper understanding of the underlying biology. Typically, such systems in vivo are very complex and difficult to study due to a lack of control over many of the variables. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Louis DeFalco Jr. of the University of Connecticut to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the National University of Singapore located in Singapore. The project title is "Exploring the Solution Behavior of the Ribosomal Translation Factor BipA." The host scientist is Dr. Ganesh Anand.<br/><br/>Coordinated global regulation of protein synthesis is essential for bacterial survival in adverse growth conditions such as amino acid starvation, temperature shock or oxidative stress. BipA is a highly conserved prokaryotic translational GTPase (hydrolase enzyme) whose interactions with the ribosome are dictated by guanine nucleotide pools in the cell, specifically levels of hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and guanosine pentaphosphate (ppGpp), an alarmone responsible for adaptation to adverse growth conditions in microorganisms. In this manner, BipA operates as a metabolic sensor, acting as the mediator between cellular processes, alerting the bacteria to current environmental conditions. This project determines how the solution behavior of BipA is altered in response to guanine nucleotide binding via hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments with mass spectrometry detection (HDXMS). This technique is used to study the formation of both binary (BipA:GTP and BipA:ppGpp) as well as the ternary 30S:BipA:ppGpp complex. Data gathered from the HDXMS studies provides the foundation for understanding how particular dynamic motions brought about by either GTP or ppGpp binding contribute to the formation of the two BipA:ribosomal species. This data serves to explicate how critical information concerning the cellular environment is conveyed between BipA and the ribosome to elicit an appropriate cellular response.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, Singapore?s status as a leader in the burgeoning medical tourism industry reflects a wider shift in the direction of global economic competition and represents a trend towards the expansion of our global community. As patients increasingly seek reasonable value for high quality medical treatment, frequent travel affords aggressive strains of microorganisms, once isolated to hospital settings, the opportunity to spread from region to region. Such proliferation of these microbes may cause a rise in communicable disease rates leading to epidemics in the near future. A focused understanding of the requirements for essential biological processes occurring in infectious organisms can lead to the rational design of targeted antibiotics capable of treating multiple types of infection in public and clinical settings worldwide.

Abstract: This action funds Donald Warren of North Carolina State University to conduct a research project in the Math and Physical Sciences during the summer of 2013 at RIKEN in Tokyo. The project title is "Simulating the Early X-Ray Afterglow in Gamma-Ray Bursts." The host scientist is Shigehiro Nagataki.<br/><br/>The early X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are important for understanding these events and their impact on cosmology. This project models the acceleration of cosmic rays, and emission from that population, using a Monte Carlo code that simulates particle interactions with a modified, ultra-relativistic, collisionless shock. This study focuses on the relation between observed parameters of X-ray afterglows (e.g. the total energy output, and the power law indices of energy flux in both wavelength and time), the characteristics of the shocks that generate the afterglows (e.g. flow speed, acceleration efficiency, or magnetic field strength), and the nature of the GRB progenitors (e.g. stellar type and size, or properties of the central engine powering the GRB). In addition, this project is obtaining spectral information about the population of cosmic rays, which can be compared against observations at Earth to see if GRBs and their afterglows are viable candidates for the source of the highest energy cosmic rays.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Jonathan Thomas Reeder of The University of Texas at Dallas to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at The Someya-Sekitani Organic Transistor Lab at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. The project title is "3D Organic Electronics Enabled by Shape Memory Polymer Substrates." The host scientist is Takao Someya.<br/><br/>Flexible electronics that can retain electrical properties through various deformations and can be interfaced with curvilinear surfaces inside the body are enabling biosensors that can read body signals on the chronic time scale by providing enhanced device-tissue interfaces. Flexible transistors based on a high-performance air-stable organic semiconductor were fabricated on a shape memory polymer (SMP) substrate. SMPs are a class of stiffness-changing smart materials that can recover an imparted strain, facilitated by a drop in modulus when heated. This smart polymer substrate and attached thin-film electronics can conform or be adjusted into various shapes by heating the substrate above its glass transition temperature, which is the temperature where the polymer becomes rubbery. Results show that by synthesizing an SMP substrate with a transition temperature near body temperature, organic transistor devices can be fabricated that soften and conform to 3D geometries when exposed to body conditions. This will enable future biomedical devices that are compliant to surrounding tissue and stationary after implantation. The softening nature of the SMP also ensures a reduction in the body?s immune response to the implanted device due to a reduction in the mismatch of stiffness between the implant and body tissue. These air-stable organic electronics have low power requirements and have sufficient electrical properties required to build biosensors or tissue stimulators. SMPs with 3D recovery states which are activated by body conditions are also enabling deployable biosensors that can actively grab or wrap around complex 3D geometries such as nerves, blood vessels, or neural tissue.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

The host scientist is Dr. Jackie Ying.<br/><br/>Every year, the World Health Organization reports that 1 in 4 people in the United States will die of cancer and that one third of the world population has tuberculosis (TB). Early detection reduces the incidence and fatal potential of cancer and highly transmittable diseases like TB. To address this, we are developing tree-like DNA nanobarcodes which use a unique ratio of fluorescent tags to detect multiple disease simultaneously. Already these barcodes are demonstrating multiplexed attomole detection using the specificity of DNA hybridization and the sensitivity of fluorescence. In the course of this EAPSI project, this system is being improved by applying it to real DNA samples and integrating it in a microfluidic device for the detection of disease anywhere in the world.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Tea Visnjic of University of California at Berkeley to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Tongji University in Shanghai, China. The project title is "Earthquake Response of Tall Buildings Equipped with Seismic Damper Devices." The host scientists are Prof. Xilin Lu and Prof. Ying Zhou.<br/><br/>The project aims to assess the dynamic response of tall reinforced concrete frame-type buildings equipped with seismic dampers. Damper devices help mitigate earthquake-induced movement of buildings, which can potentially lead to smaller damage. Tall reinforced concrete frames are particularly vulnerable to high post-earthquake reparation costs and prolonged disruption of occupancy due to repairs. The use of damper devices in these buildings may be able to significantly improve seismic performance, but such applications have been limited partly due to limited understanding of the effects of supplemental damping in seismic applications to tall concrete frames. Because tall reinforced concrete frame buildings are commonly constructed in both China and the seismically active parts of the United States, an improved understanding of supplemental damping effects on seismic behavior of such systems is beneficial to design practices in both countries. The planned study quantifies the effects of damper application on structural response of these buildings and identifies damper systems that most effectively achieve improvements in earthquake performance.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Furthermore, the proposed collaboration between researchers from the two universities with established records of intellectual contribution to seismic hazard reduction is motivated by the value in exchanging diverse ideas, complementing research and invaluable experience from past earthquakes. The study opens the door for future partnerships between the two institutions and contributes to global advancement in efforts to protect human life and economic well-being from natural disasters.

Abstract: This action funds Jamie Smith of Ohio University to conduct a research project in Education and Human Resource Development during the summer of 2013 at the University of Southern Queensland in Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia. The project title is "Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge Development in Science Teacher Preparation: A Mixed Methods Case Study in Queensland, Australia." The host scientist is Dr. Peter Albion.<br/><br/>This study seeks to identify key characteristics that impact the development of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) in the science teacher preparation program at a large university in Queensland, Australia. TPACK is a conceptual framework of a body of knowledge from which teachers draw to influence practice; it is a dynamic and emergent form of knowledge that informs the employment of technology for teaching specific subject matter. This study employs a mixed methods case study approach, including delivery of a TPACK survey instrument, class observations, faculty and student interviews, and document analyses, to identify the key characteristics that influence the development of TPACK among preservice science teachers. The research addresses a specific need cited in the literature, identifying TPACK impact factors, and lays a foundation for the conception of a theoretical model of TPACK development. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. As our nation strives to remain competitive in a knowledge- and innovation-driven global economy, the preparation of quality teachers, specifically in STEM fields, is a critical issue. Research conducted through this fellowship yields significant implications for this agenda. Findings will be disseminated in the instructional technology, science education, and teacher education fields via international conferences, scholarly journal articles and practitioner publications. This study on TPACK in development in science teacher preparation broadens the current, narrower focus of Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) in science education. As both the host and fellow teach courses relevant to this topic for pre-service teachers and work closely with science methods faculty, the potential exists for active application and continued collaboration at both institutions. Results of the study help inform the preparation of quality science educators on a global scale.

Abstract: This action funds Ellen A. Lamont of the University of Connecticut, Center for Integrative Geosciences to conduct a research project in Geosciences during the summer of 2013 at National Cheng-Kung University, Department of Earth Sciences Tainan, Taiwan. The project title is "Using Earthquake-Generated 3-D Imagery and GPS-Based Deformation Models to Understand a Plate Collision Zone in Taiwan." The host scientist is Dr. Ruey-Juin Rau.<br/><br/>This grant funds an integrative study of the geologically young Taiwan collisional zone that utilizes seismic, tomographic, and geodetic datasets (previously collected by a series of NSF supported instrumentation arrays). The anomalously high convergence rate (82mm/yr toward 330) (Lee and Chan, 2007) has created spectacular topography (~3km) adjacent to large coastal planes and has caused a complicated crustal architecture to develop. The study area occurs at one of the youngest portions of the developing orogen and allows us to study these fundamental processes as they occur. Preliminary investigations of the area reveal a suite of earthquakes beneath the deforming orogenic material (i.e. beneath the decollment) and a conspicuous, high-velocity zone at 40km depth in tomographic imagery that may be controlling how the orogen deforms. From such findings, the Fellow hypothesizes two possible scenarios: 1) the primary decollment is stepping down into deeper continental basement possibly creating a new detachment over which the orogen is growing; 2) the deep seismicity and high velocity zone represent a change in the chemical composition of the lower crust. A different type of crust would behave differently under stress and may well be the source of the deep seismicity.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Further knowledge about the fundamental processes occurring in collisional systems is applicable to the study of other collisional systems, modern and historical. A protocol could also be developed pertaining to acceptable ways to integrate non-related datasets effectively. More directly, active collision zones are sources for great earthquakes (i.e. the 1999 Chi-Chi Earthquake in Taiwan, the Chilean Earthquake, the 2011 Japan Earthquake, etc.) that cause millions of dollars in damage and the loss of countless innocent lives. Advancing our knowledge of the way in which the crust deforms during collision would move us one step closer to developing more accurate models of fault locations, hazard identification and early warning systems, affectively reducing costs, both economic and human. Furthermore, Components of this project will also be used to supplement classroom lectures/activities and will enhance the research experience of early-career students in the United States and abroad. The results of this project will be made available to the wider tectonics and structural geology community through presentations at scientific conferences and the publication of the Fellow's master's thesis.

Abstract: This action funds Michael Edward Page of Florida International University to conduct an interdisciplinary research project at the intersection of Geosciences, Engineering, and Physical Sciences during the summer of 2013 at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan. The project title is "High Pressure Synthesis of Phases Appropriate for Earth's Interior." The host scientist is Dr. Eiji Ohtani.<br/><br/>This project aims to expand the available knowledge of geophysical materials appropriate for the core of earth and other terrestrial planets. High pressure combined with high temperature in situ analyses reveals much about mantle materials, including but not limited to compressibility and sound velocity, and will help predict seismic events. This project tests available thermodynamic database predictions over a wide range of compositions, and physical conditions from crust to core. Between thermodynamics databases, not all calorimetric data agree at the physical conditions present in the center of the earth, and this project aims to obtain a match between the calorimetric data sets and experimental values. This research transcends the fields of physics, chemistry, and the geosciences, and has significance towards the understanding of earthquake pressure wave velocities. It will be conducted in the heart of a region, Sendai, still reeling from the threefold effects of natural devastation due to earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear radiation contamination. Thermodynamic relations require that the physical data we obtain through our experiments attest to the relationships that ought to exist between thermochemistry and thermophysics. An internal consistency in such data gives us the confidence to model the planetary interiors and surfaces and lets us compare the profile with data obtained independently through our planetary missions. Because of the broad utilization of thermodynamics by many scientific disciplines, thermodynamic data of many sorts are crucial to scientific progress.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

While the existence of these weak hydrogen bonds has been demonstrated previously, this work investigates the timescale on which these hydrogen bonds are broken and formed. The compounds being studied include simple amino acid and sugar monomers in aqueous solutions, as well as organic solvents. The results obtained are expected to be broadly applicable toward understanding the dynamics of biological macromolecular structures.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this collaboration promotes the sharing of expertise and ideas between the two research groups involved, with the hope of prolonged collaborations that extend beyond the duration of the summer program. Researchers from both groups benefit, both personally and professionally, from this international collaboration. The PI hopes to pursue additional international collaborations in the future, and this project helps to demonstrate the challenges and benefits of such endeavors. Upon completion of the project, the results of this research will be presented at the PI's host institution and are intended to be published in a peer reviewed journal.

Abstract: This action funds Elizabeth A. Jensen of the University of Minnesota to conduct a research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at Tohoku Gakuin University in Sendai, Japan. The project title is "Distributed Algorithms for Multi-Robot Dispersion and Exploration." The host scientist is Dr. Ken Sugawara.<br/><br/>In recent years, using a team of robots has become a popular method for exploring both known and unknown environments. In particular, teams of robots are being used with increasing frequency in areas such as surveillance or search and rescue. In this research, the primary interest is in scenarios in which there are too few robots to completely cover an environment simultaneously, where communication is limited in range, and where the robots are required to maintain communication with at least one other robot at all times. These restrictions make the exploration and coordination of the team more complicated, but simplify the robots needed, thus making team of these robots more attainable and easier to maintain or replace. This project includes the development of one or more distributed algorithms for dispersion of a multi-robot team into an unknown environment. The performance of the algorithms is being tested in both simulation and experiments with physical robots in a variety of environments, including office building and open cave scenarios. This project will lead to increases in the ability of simple, inexpensive robots to explore large and complex indoor environments, making them more useful in real life situations, such as search and rescue or Mars exploration.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this research will also provide algorithms for multi-robot exploration, disseminated through publications and participation in conferences and workshops, which can be used in courses to teach about distributed systems and robotics.

Abstract: This action funds William Hilton of Drexel University to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the HuboLab in Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Daejeon. The project title is "Enabling a Humanoid Robot to Play Piano Through Improved Hands." The host scientist is Jun Oh.<br/><br/>The aim of this research project is to integrate a pair of robotic hands capable of playing a standard piano into the design of the next generation Hubo humanoid developed at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). The Fellow works in Dr. Youngmoo Kim's Music Entertainment Technology lab (MET-lab) at Drexel University, where a goal is to enable humanoid robots to play in music ensembles with human performers. Hubo's current hands are optimal for gripping large objects, because they have underactuated fingers that passively curl around an object. However, because they are underactuated, they do not have the precision control needed to play most musical instruments. The Fellow is leading a team at MET-lab to develop a new set of inexpensive dexterous hands that will have 15 degrees of freedom, allowing Hubo to play piano. At HuboLab, the Fellow is continuing to develop the hands and is working with the Korean counterparts to connect them to Hubo's electrical, mechanical, and software systems. Although the specific motivation for the current project is music, the applications of dexterous hands are many, and improved hands will enable many advanced applications of humanoids involving fine manipulation. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the new hands have the potential to be adopted widely and used by many researchers, including those at the more than half a dozen universities in the U.S. with their own Hubo. Videos and demos of Hubo playing piano will engage the general public, stimulate discussion about the fusion of science and art, and encourage children to pursue fields in science and engineering. The Fellow plans to give talks and presentations about the experience in Korea to fellow students at Drexel, his alma mater the University of Cincinnati, and to neighboring high schools in the Philadelphia area.

Abstract: This action funds Abby Schadock-Hewitt of Clemson University to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. The project title is "Modeling of a Unique Shaped-Fiber Stationary Phase for the Large-Scale Purification of Antibodies." The host scientists are Dr. Simone Dimartino and Dr. Conan Fee.<br/><br/>The proposed project involves characterization and modeling of a novel recombinant protein A- modified affinity chromatography stationary phase for the capture and recovery of immunoglobulin G (IgG). IgG is necessary for antibody-based therapeutics, a rapidly growing field that requires high quantities of highly pure antibody to be separated from complex fermentation broths in an efficient, fast, cost effective way. This work focuses on capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers modified with protein A (the affinity capture ligand for IgG), which show excellent potential, at the analytical scale, in overcoming the drawbacks of costly commercially available resins. Modeling of protein A-modified C-CP fibers is essential to determine if their advantageous properties hold at a preparative, industry suitable, scale. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this project encourages incorporation of engineering ideas and perspectives toward the analytical scale implementation of C-CP fiber columns. The Fellow will be able to bring this engineering perspective to other chemist colleagues by giving a presentation of the knowledge gained. Successful completion of the proposed work will open up many opportunities for future modification and modeling studies; taking the discovery steps into the practical realm. This will promote development of other novel C-CP fiber modifications and allow for the continued collaboration with the host researchers, possibly opening up new collaborations, and resulting in conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications. The fibers current educational applications applied at Clemson will grow from the information gained, allowing for added applications.

Abstract: This action funds Anne Marti of The University of Texas at Dallas to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at The National Tsing University in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The project title is "The Design and Characterization of Novel Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for carbon dioxide Capture." The host scientist is Dr. Sue-Lein Wang.<br/><br/>The global consumption of energy has steadily increased each year due to population and industrial growth, thus issues such as global warming have received much attention. As a result, scientists have been investigating ways to reduce carbon dioxide produced from the burning of fossil fuels. One approach is carbon capture and sequestration technologies, which allow carbon dioxide to be captured and stored. Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline hybrid-like materials that consist of metal ions and organic linkers) that combine to form a variety of porous structures tunable to meet application requirements. MOFs can have high surface areas, large pores, and can be thermally and chemically stable for gas storage, separation, catalysis, and chemical sensing. MOFs are potential candidates for carbon dioxide capture due to their unsaturated metal sites and organic moieties that can have a high affinity for carbon dioxide. New MOFs for carbon dioxide capture have been synthesized. They are being characterized at the host University in order to determine their crystal structures using single crystal x-ray diffraction. This technique helps determine the MOF's internal lattice characteristics such as bond angles, lengths and other details of site ordering. The information gathered allows the MOF's performance to be evaluated for carbon dioxide capture. The study is based on extensive characterization of new materials for carbon dioxide capture; therefore it is expected to provide new insights to the scientific community in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the proposed research study is anticipated to promote not only scientific collaboration between the current and host Universities but bring a positive outlook about the experience to other graduate/undergraduate students from these areas. The fellow will learn valuable communication skills from this experience, which will aid in the teaching of current and future graduate/undergraduate, and high school students all of whom work within the Fellow?s group. Being of Hispanic descent, the Fellow's experience may influence other minority groups to apply and participate in higher learning experiences.

Abstract: This action funds Christien Philip Laber of Rutgers University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at the University of Tsukuba in Tsukuba, Japan. The project title is "Coccolithovirus Presence and Active Infection of the Phytoplankton Emiliania Huxleyi in the Northwest Pacific Ocean." The host scientist is Yoshihiro Shiraiwa.<br/><br/>The phytoplankton Emiliania huxleyi is a coccolithophore found in most regions of the ocean and is known for producing large summer bloom populations in the North Atlantic frequently terminated by a double stranded DNA virus called coccolithovirus (EhV), "short circuiting" carbon transport to higher food web levels and influencing the biogeochemical cycling of carbon. This host-virus interaction has not yet been documented in the Pacific Ocean. This project uses a set of nucleic acid and lipid based molecular tools to probe Pacific waters for the presence, diversity, and activity of coccolithovirus off the west coast of Japan. This includes the detection of evolutionarily similar sphingolipid biosynthesis genes in E. huxleyi and EhV as well as viral glycosphingolipids (vGSLs), which are reliable lipid based markers for EhV presence and activity in natural assemblage. Nucleic acid tools are used to investigate the historical presence and preservation of EhV in the sediment record as well. Laboratory experiments are also being conducted to observe the interaction of cultured E. huxleyi and EhV with viral concentrates and coccolithophores of natural assemblage. This approach addresses whether EhVs are prominent in the western Pacific, if the vGSL biosynthetic pathways triggered during viral infection are similar to those used by North Atlantic EhV, if natural conditions are sufficient for infection to progress, and the historical preservation of EhV infection in regional sediment. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the results will increase our understanding of EhV distribution, which will provide a platform for diversity, ecological, and biogeochemical studies. Laber will also work with COSEE NOW at the Institute of Marine and Coastal Science at Rutgers to translate and broadcast the study and experience to the public.

Abstract: This action funds Arianna Lark of University of Iowa to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at Nagoya University in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. The project title is "Imaging Neuronal Activity to Identify the Role of Novel Steroid Hormone Receptors in Stress Behaviors." The host scientist is Dr. Azusa Kamikouchi.<br/><br/>Steroid hormones such as estrogen and testosterone play many important roles in behavior and development. Steroid hormones are generally thought to bind to receptors within cells and modulate gene expression. However, besides this relatively slow steroid signaling pathway, there are other faster pathways steroid hormones can initiate. In one of these noncanonical pathways, steroid hormones bind to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) at the cell surface and set off a cascade of changes which can quickly modify the cell. In neurons, these fast changes to the cell may alter its activity within its network; this in turn can alter the behavior of the organism. Several of these receptors have been recently identified including a GPCR for estrogen in humans. Unfortunately many results from studies of this receptor have been conflicted likely due to the high complexity of the mammalian system. Recently a cell membrane-bound steroid hormone receptor, DopEcR, has been identified in Drosophila (fruit flies). Drosophila has a simpler nervous system with many tools to manipulate genes and is an excellent model to study the mechanisms underlying regulation of behaviors. It has recently been identified that mutants for Drosophila DopEcR have defects in a behavioral response to stress: starvation-induced sleep suppression. Starvation induced sleep suppression has been observed in humans, rats and flies and likely results from an evolutionarily conserved response to food scarcity which overrides sleep urges to induce food searching behaviors. Dr. Kamikouchi and colleagues have expertise in a technique to image activity of the neurons in a living fruit fly. Using this technique this project identifies starvation initiated changes in neuronal activity mediated by DopEcR.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, these results are expected to lead to a better understanding of the function of membrane-bound steroid hormone receptors within the brain as well as a greater general understanding of behavioral regulation by steroids.

Abstract: This action funds Justin Wilcox of the University of Notre Dame to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at Duke-NUS Medical school in Singapore. The project title is "Exploring the Role of Parasitic Worms in Enzoic Disease Transmission." The host scientists are Dr. Gavin Smith and Dr. Ian Mendenhall. <br/><br/>Parasitic worms (i.e. helminthes) are known to increase the pathology and transmission of several important diseases (including HIV infection, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis C) through modulation of host immunity during simultaneous coinfection. However, the commonality of such interactions between helminthes and micropathogens is not well known due to uncertainties regarding the mechanisms of immune modulation by parasitic worms. To address this shortcoming, this project is exploring the importance of different types of helminth infection to microparasite immunity in a wild population of long-tailed macaques living in close association with humans in Singapore. Through the comparative assessment of immunomodulatory abilities of different helminthes, the results may ultimately allow for new insights into the control of infectious disease, and the use of helminthes in the treatment of autoimmune disease.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Michael Schulz of the University of Florida to conduct a research project in the Math and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan. The project title is "Understanding the Connection between Binding and Molecular Architecture in Polymer-Metal Mixtures." The host scientist is Yoshiki Chujo.<br/><br/>Polyethyleneimine-methylphosphonate (PEI-MP) is an anionic polymer--a negatively charged large molecule--that has been studied as a polymeric ligand to bind to certain metals, specifically radioactivce atoms, or radionuclides. However, the binding of PEI-MP to radionuclides is not understood at a fundamental level. This project is studying various potential binding configurations of the polymer system with a simplified, small molecule system. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is being used to measure the thermodynamic parameters of each binding mode. This information provides insight into which molecular configurations form the most stable coordinate complexes, i.e., which are the most effective at binding to different metals. Understanding the binding of PEI-MP at a fundamental level will allow the rational design and improvement of future polymeric radionuclide carriers. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Keats Conley of University of Oregon to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at Hiroshima University in Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. The project title is "Behavior and Survival of Moon Jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) Larvae Under Various Environmental Conditions." The host scientist is Dr. Shin-ichi Uye.<br/><br/>Moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) mature in June-August in Hiroshima Bay and release free-swimming larvae called "planulae." This study investigates the behavior and survival, or physioecology, of planulae under various environmental conditions (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, light). Planulae are also eaten by common filter feeding organisms, such as oysters, mussels, and tunicates. This research measures the feeding rates on the planulae by these organisms. Since larvae generally have very high mortality rates, environmental factors such as these can have large impacts on survival, subsequently affecting adult jellyfish abundance. This work carries social and economic significance because some regions have experienced increasingly frequent and severe jellyfish blooms, which present a grave threat to some fishing industries, aquaculture farms, tourism and coastal industry. In Japan, blooms of moon jellyfish have imposed significant costs on fisheries by clogging and bursting fishing nets. In the U.S., the notorious "slime bank" of the Bering Sea is seasonally unfishable because of jellyfish abundance; blooms, therefore, present a global economic threat, not just a national one. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, results from this EAPSI research collaboration on jellyfish larval response to different environmental parameters may ultimately be used to help predict variations in populations, conveying societal benefits by helping various industries to manage the socioeconomic damages imposed by jellyfish. The EAPSI host researcher is a member of a national counter-jellyfish project (STOPJELLY), leading the development of new technology to predict and control jellyfish outbreaks; through this collaboration, the EAPSI fellow is acquiring exposure to such technologies, which may ultimately have applications for coastal management and policy. This project also helps enhance the average citizen?s scientific understanding of jellyfish by using the Newport Aquarium, which attracts over 40,000 students each year, as a site for a public display on the significance of research findings.

Abstract: This action funds Joseph Hollmann of Northeastern University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at National Taiwan University in Taipei. The project title is "Analysis and Modeling of Ultrasound-Modulated Light in Tissue to Reduce the Effects of Scattering." The host scientist is Professor Snow Tseng.<br/><br/>Optical interrogation of tissue uses non-ionizing radiation and has high biological specificity. However, its application in biomedical imaging is limited because, in most tissues, scattering masks physiologically important information such as optical absorption. Recent work has shown phase conjugation of a scattered probe beam can be utilized to reduce scattering and allow for focusing deep within tissue. We can dynamically determine this focal point by modulating an optical wave with an ultrasound beam to create a reference point, or "guidestar," and achieve ultrasound resolution imaging to depths of multiple millimeters. This project analyzes the coherent properties of an optical signal propagating in a scattering medium to determine its effects on the formation of the ultrasound-modulated guidestar.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the Fellow will extend the benefits of this experience to others in several ways. First, the results will be presented to Prof. Tseng's research group at the conclusion of the program. Second, after traveling back to the United States, the research as well as the experience in Taiwan as a Fellow will be presented to the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University. During the fall, the Fellow will travel to Brownsville, Texas, a community with a large minority population, and offer a series of discussions to local high school students about engineering, research and the experience in Taiwan. The Fellow will mentor students in programs designed to enhance representation of under-served populations, such as the Young Scholars and Research Experience for Undergrads programs. Finally, the Fellow will continue to collaborate with Prof. Tseng's group to ensure the results of the summer?s work are disseminated by publishing papers and giving presentations at conferences.

Abstract: This action funds Kimberly Suzanne Bowen of the University of Utah to conduct a research project in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Kyoto University Kokoro Research Center in Kyoto, Japan. The project title is "Social Support and Health: Examining Cultural Pathways of Belonging Social Support and Giving Social Support to Mental and Physical Well-Being." The host scientist is Yukiko Uchida, Ph.D.<br/><br/>The Intellectual Merit of the research project includes examining individual and cultural similarities and differences in the psychological pathways linking interpersonal social support to individual well-being. It compares the effectiveness of different types of social support in increasing or reducing well-being as a function of affirming or threatening culturally-relevant self-concepts, such as the self as efficacious, independent, and accomplished (in independent cultures) or the self as socially connected and harmonious (in interdependent cultures). It also examines whether findings in the United States that giving and receiving support similarly affect well-being are replicable in other cultural settings. To address this, participants from the United States and Japan are completing daily measures of social support, self-esteem, social connectedness, mental well-being, and physical health over three weeks of daily life. Additionally, greater understanding of these cultural processes have implications for improved intervention design in international disaster relief and educational diversity.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. It meets the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Findings will be disseminated through guest presentations at both Japanese and American universities, poster presentations at conferences, as well as teaching guest lectures in undergraduate courses on cultural psychology and social support.

Abstract: This action funds Patrick Ryan Thomas of the University of Missouri, Kansas City (UMKC) to conduct a research project in physics during the summer of 2013 at the Department of Chemistry, School of Science and Technology, Kwansei Gakuin University in Japan. The project title is "Using Relativity in Calculations of the Optical and Electronic Properties of Materials." The host scientist is Professor Kazuyoshi Ogasawara.<br/><br/>This research consists of two specific objectives to improve the representation of the wave function within the orthogonalized linear combination of atomic orbitals (OLCAO) method for technologically important materials, in this case Cerium doped YAG laser crystals. <br/>The first goal is to include relativistic effects in the wave function. Such relativistic orbitals are necessary but not sufficient for accurately computing key material properties such as the total energy and eliminating excessive errors which result in present calculations. The second objective is to develop an accurate approach to calculate the relativistic kinetic energy contribution by making use of a linear combination of kinetic energy calculations for isolated atoms.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture, and language.

Abstract: This action funds Vu Nguyen of the University of Colorado at Boulder to conduct a research project in Geoscience during the summer of 2013 at National Central University in Jhongli, Taiwan. The project title is "Impacts on the Upper Atmosphere from Long Period Planetary Waves Generated from Below." The host scientist is Dr. Loren Chang.<br/><br/>The research project investigates the ways in which planetary waves, global-scale atmospheric oscillations generated in the lower/middle atmosphere, can drive the variability of the upper atmosphere. It specifically focuses on the 16-day planetary wave and its effects on the upper atmosphere through nonlinear interactions with atmospheric tides. The first phase of the project involves the implementation of the 16-day planetary wave in an atmospheric general circulation model developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Model results are utilized to identify the main mechanisms through which the effects of the 16-day planetary wave are transmitted to the upper atmosphere. The second phase of the project compares the model results to observations from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology Ionospheric and Climate (COSMIC), a satellite mission funded jointly by Taiwan and the United States. The results of the project will improve our understanding of the atmosphere as a complete system and eventually be utilized to make better predictions for the upper atmosphere, a region housing space technology that is critical to the progress of science and the functioning of global society.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds David Grant Colburn Hildebrand of Harvard University to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in Ulsan, Korea. The project title is "Automatically Finding the Same Neurons in Optical and Electron Microscopy Datasets to Enable Investigations of the Relationship Between Structure and Function in the brain." The host scientist is Won-Ki Jeong, Ph.D.<br/><br/>Determining how the connectivity of neuronal circuits influences their functional properties is one of the most difficult endeavors the field of neuroscience has ever faced. This is due to the fact that these studies require untangling and making sense of dense hairballs of dendrites and axons known as neuropil. While we now have methods to create neuronal connectivity maps, few experimental techniques and software tools for linking studies of neuron functional properties to those of neuronal circuit connectivity exist. This project creates software that resolves this problem after interrogating which computational algorithms are best suited to identifying, localizing, and corresponding the same neurons in optical and electron microscopy datasets, which provide information about neuron function and circuit structure, respectively. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this project will generate open-source software tools that make it possible for others in the field to perform similar studies and for teachers to bring together students interested in life sciences and computer science. Small example datasets will be made available with the software tools for teachers and self-learners to illustrate to students how relatively simple "connect-the-dots" relationships in the brain can carry important implications for biological function.

Abstract: This action funds Jonathan M. Monk of the University of California, San Diego to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology in Nara, Japan. The project title is "Improving Characterization of E. Coli Genes Using Genome-Scale Computational Models and High-Throughput Experimental Screens." The host scientist is Dr. Hirotada Mori.<br/><br/>Nobel Prize recipient Dr. Jacques Monod said, "What is true for E. coli is true for the elephant," indicating that knowledge gained from an organism as seemingly simple as E. coli is broadly applicable to all living organisms. This project combines computational modeling with high-throughput experiments to improve understanding of how gene products interact to achieve cellular objectives and confer robustness in Escherichia coli. Traditionally, determining genetic interactions is a very challenging and time consuming process, but new technologies are changing this. Large scale double mutant libraries can now be constructed to screen for genetic interactions. Analyzing these datasets can be done efficiently by using biochemical network reconstructions that contain up-to-date information on molecular components and their interactions in an organism. This NSF award funds research that combines the Fellow's expertise in systems biology modeling with the expertise of the host institution in experimental double mutant screens to identify and better characterize the effect of genetic interactions on E. coli metabolism. The project is furthering the understanding of gene function and pathway architecture in this important model organism and could ultimately lead to the development of novel combinatorial antibiotic therapies. The discovery of new metabolic activities and genes will be useful for metabolic engineering, fundamental biological understanding and drug design where newly identified enzymes could prove to be novel targets for new antibiotic therapies to fight against pathogenic bacteria.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. This NSF award represents an important collaboration between the Systems Biology Research Group at UCSD and the Nara Institute of Science and Technology. Both of these groups share the goal of studying the systems biology of E. coli and have complementary research expertise and equipment. The result is a productive collaboration that will last for years. The results of this award will also be used in education. The methodologies and results of this project will be incorporated into UCSD courses to teach the experimental aspects of systems biology and will be used for educational purposes in class projects. Additionally, important discoveries resulting from this project will be published in high profile scientific journals and new gene and protein annotations will be submitted to public databases to ensure worldwide dissemination of this information.

Abstract: This action funds Emily Ruth McCarthy of William Marsh Rice University to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Hongik Univeristy in Seoul, South Korea. The project title is "Improving the Seismic Reliability of Bridges with Innovative Shape Memory Alloy Devices." The host scientist is Dr. Eunsoo Choi.<br/><br/>Within transportation networks bridges are recognized as the most vulnerable links during earthquakes, with associated damage resulting in high repair costs and socio-economic disruption to the affected region. Through the use of innovative shape memory alloy devices, which can be strategically placed within an analytical bridge model, improvements in bridge reliability (i.e. the probability of survival) can be demonstrated for representative seismic events. Many existing methods for enhancing bridges' seismic resistance focus on developing components that activate in a single directional of motion while the device presented in this work aims to exploit the material's superelasticity effect to limit detrimental effects due to multi-directional displacements. The superelasticity effect most notably describes the material's ability to recover large deformations after application and removal of stress. Improved bridge reliability translates into increased public safety and long term reduction of related repair costs. Through fragility analysis, which describes the probability of failure of a system or component given a set intensity measure, the effectiveness of the proposed device to improve reliability is demonstrated.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the specific benefits of pursuing this research topic relate to improving public safety during seismic events and reducing post-event repair costs related to bridge damage. Additionally emergency responders requiring immediate connectivity between regions need functioning bridges and this maintenance of functionality can be facilitated through the incorporation of shape memory alloy devices in the system.

The project title is "Road User Vulnerability - Impacts of the New E-Bike Mode." The host scientist is Dr. Yang Xinmiao.<br/><br/>This research is an opportunity to explore crash histories for users of all modes of traffic in Beijing, China. Although this project aims to focus on safety for modes, it concentrates specifically on electric bicycles (e-bikes). While a handful of studies have touched different aspects of multimodal safety, this study brings a new approach to safety, focusing on vulnerability and fault. This approach moves away from classic safety analysis (counting and normalizing injuries and fatalities) and focuses on quantifying vulnerability and fault. This is an important contribution because it moves policy toward protecting vulnerable road users (VRU) (e.g., bicyclists) from what is hypothesized as intrinsically dangerous road users (e.g., cars) rather than pointing at the VRU as the dangerous element in the transportation system simply because they are more represented in crash statistics.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the goal of this project is to help policy makers establish a policy in effort to reduce the number of e-bike crashes, which focuses on saving lives. This project can also help educate all modes of the transportation infrastructure on the vulnerabilities of e-bikes and make them more alert to e-bikes. In effort to broadcast the results, this project will be submitted to top safety journals and the results will be presented at conferences in the US and China. The results and traveling experience will also be presented at the Institute of Transportation Engineers and American Society of Civil Engineers meetings at the University of Tennessee Knoxville.

Abstract: This action funds Aubree Webb of The Pennsylvania State University to conduct a research project in the Education and Human Resource area during the summer of 2013 at the Computer Network Information Center (CNIC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China. The project title is "Virtual Inquiry Projects in Science Classrooms: Do Grizzly Bears and 3-D Avatars Impact Students' Inquiry Skills?." The host scientist is Xiao Yun, Professor and Director of the Internet-based Science Communication Center at the Computer Network Information Center in the Chinese Academy of Sciences.<br/><br/>Incorporating technology into the classroom is an important goal of science educators. While there are increasing numbers of studies in this area, there are not many with cross-cultural measures. Studying the cross-cultural outcomes of authentic web-based inquiry has the potential to contribute much to the field of science education. The purpose of this project is to advance the collaboration between the Computer Network Information Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Texas A&M University, and the Pennsylvania State University. This project introduces a project called Bear Cam and adapts the ongoing Virtual Ecological Inquiry project for a cross-cultural study. Bear Cam is a web-based inquiry database with images of bears. Virtual Ecological Inquiry is an immersive inquiry where students operate an avatar around the virtual Wolong Nature Reserve. In each project, students complete an inquiry project and produce a final report meeting current science standards in obtaining, evaluating, and communicating data.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this study can inform software developers and teachers about the best way to reach students in highly diverse settings. Virtual and web-based inquiry also has the added benefit of increasing student interaction with other students from geographically diverse locations, an important experience in an increasingly global world. If the web-based inquiry projects increase student interest and learning outcomes in ecology across various learning settings and with diverse student populations, the next step is for the researcher to scale up and develop the technology for easy access into ecology classrooms and informal science education settings in the United States and across the world. One goal of the entire collaboration is to motivate more students from a range of backgrounds, especially those underrepresented in science, to pursue a career in one of the STEM fields. The Fellow will share results with those interested in science and technology by presenting at international and international conferences and university-level research seminars and publishing in related journals.

Abstract: This action funds Nicholas Nuar of The University of Pittsburgh Department of Bioengineering to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at Peking University in Beijing, China. The project title is "Biosensor Development Using Membrane Protein Receptors." The host scientist is Dr. Can Xie.<br/><br/>Membrane receptors are proteins embedded in the cellular membrane that mediate the communication between the cell and its environment. It is therefore intuitive to use membrane receptors for biosensor development for technological applications in a biomimetic approach. The principle is general so that such a technology platform can be extended to potentially be able to detect and assay thousands of biologically relevant compounds. This project extends the system to a plant membrane receptor, the ethylene receptor, studied by Prof. Can Xie in China. Ethylene (C2H4) is an important plant growth substance that is used industrially to induce ripening in stored plant products. Its receptor is not homologous to the insulin receptor and its transmembrane structure is quite different, and kinase activity is either histidine or serine/threonine specific. This study investigates a plant ethylene receptor, NTHK1. Unique among identified plant hormone receptors, the ethylene receptors are transmembrane receptors just like hormone receptors, such as EGFR in animals. This activity studies the expression, purification, and assay setup necessary to continue investigating the protein in collaboration with Dr. Xie. The ultimate goal of the Fellow's PhD project is to harness understanding of these highly tuned receptor kinase systems to make an extensible platform for novel biosensing capabilities. This project will have an impact on the speed, accuracy, and number of readily analyzable chemical species.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the Fellow will strengthen a collaboration between the Klein-Seetharaman lab and the Xie laboratories. High impact, low cost solutions to laboratory instrumentation are ultimate downstream aims from the program of research.

Abstract: This action funds Carolyn Keogh of University of Georgia to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at Kochi University in Kochi, Japan. The project title is "Ecoimmunology of Invasions: Testing the Effect of Parasite Release on Investment in Immune Defense." The host scientists are Dr. Gyo Itani and Dr. Osamu Miura.<br/><br/>Invasive species are thought to experience a reprieve from regulation by natural enemies such as parasites and predators, which may contribute to the demographic success they often achieve in their recipient ranges. This project uses a highly invasive marine invertebrate, the Asian shore crab, Hemigrapsus sanguineus, as a model system for testing the effect of parasite release on energy allocation and susceptibility to future infections. The project compares important defense and fitness traits between individuals from the invasive and native populations using techniques from the fast-growing field of ecoimmunology to determine whether resource allocation to immune defenses trades off with investment in other fitness components. The goal of this project is to contribute a new perspective to our understanding of the short- and long-term consequences of enemy escape for invasive species success. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Thomas Heider of the University of Connecticut to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the University of Melbourne in Melbourne Australia. The project title is "Wallabase: Jump starting the tammar wallaby genome database." The host scientist is Professor Marilyn Renfree.<br/><br/>A key challenge in genomics is distinguishing the regions of DNA that are essential for development and disease from those that are nonfunctional. The genomics community is rapidly coming to appreciate the power of marsupial comparative genetics for this task. Aided by extensive developmental and physiological data, the tammar wallaby has proven instrumental for the study of developmental processes that are conserved among mammals. To make this information more accessible to researchers, this project creates the genome database, Wallabase. Wallabase lowers the barriers that prevent the broader scientific community from utilizing marsupials in deciphering the human genome. In particular, researchers trying to identify novel antimicrobials, those in the dairy industry and clinicians utilizing the unique development of the wallaby will greatly benefit from the accessibility of the information on Wallabase.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, there will be additional sections on Wallabase that will educate the general public about the use of wallabies in research and about the importance of comparative studies.

Abstract: This action funds Josh Egan of The University of Minnesota Conservation Biology Program to conduct a research project in Biological sciences during the summer of 2013 at National Chiayi University in Chiayi, Taiwan. The project title is "The Evolution of Generalist Feeding Strategies in Marine Fishes." The host scientist is Dr. Chien-Hsien Kuo.<br/><br/>The evolution of specialized trophic niches has been extensively researched. This research has shown that trophic niche specialization is stimulated by complex, stable, and productive habitats and promotes speciation and the evolution of phenotypic diversity. In contrast, generalist trophic niches, although recognized as common, have been the focus of few evolutionary studies. This represents a significant gap in our understanding of the generation and distribution of biodiversity. To address this gap, this research uses phylogenetic comparative methods to test two fundamental hypotheses regarding the evolution of generalist trophic niches: (1) the evolution of generalist trophic niches is associated with transitions to habitats with temporally variable food webs and (2) the evolution of generalist trophic niches is associated with morphological and behavioral adaptation. The project uses the clupeiform fishes as a study system to address these questions because this order is diverse, widely distributed, and contains trophic generalists.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this research will advance our understanding of evolutionary processes and species richness patterns, knowledge that is increasingly used to inform biodiversity conservation and management efforts.

Abstract: This action funds Kevin P. Klubek of the University of Rochester to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the Institute of Functional Nano & Soft Materials (FUNSOM), Soochow University in Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. The project title is "Blue Emitters for Organic Light-Emitting Diodes." The host scientist is Professor Liang-Sheng Liao.<br/><br/>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are a new technology being developed for display (replacing liquid crystal and plasma technologies) and solid state lighting applications (replacing incandescent and fluorescent lighting). OLEDs contain several layers of organic (carbon based materials) thin films sandwiched between two electrodes. When a battery is connected to the electrodes, a current passes into the organic materials and one of the layers emits light. Depending on molecular structure, the organic materials can emit red, green or blue light, and all three colors are needed for most applications. While OLEDs have an ability to achieve high brightness with low power consumption, blue emitting OLEDs have a significantly shorter lifetime (time for the initial brightness to decrease by 50%) than red or green emitting OLEDs. The research shown in this work compares various blue emitting materials in an effort to understand how molecular structure impacts device performance, notably that of device lifetime. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the research effort between Soochow University and the University of Rochester (UR) will lay the foundation for forging a strong ongoing relationship as these universities have many shared interests that extend beyond the OLED field. One of the key goals is to widely distribute the scientific and technological understanding that is achieved by publishing in peer reviewed journals and presenting at conferences. Furthermore, the Fellow will give a presentation outlining his research to the host university and a comparable presentation on the collaboration with the Tang lab and his stay in China on return to his home institution. Both presentations will promote the importance and benefits of the NSF EAPSI fellowship.

Abstract: This action funds Andrew Ronald Friedman of the University of California, Berkeley to conduct a research project in Geoscience during the summer of 2013 at the Research Center for Environmental Changes, Academia Sinica, in Taipei, Taiwan. The project title is "Variability of the Hemispheric Temperature Contrast." The host scientist is Dr. Shih-Yu Lee.<br/><br/>The research project investigates the variability of the temperature contrast between the northern and southern hemispheres and its relationship with tropical rainfall. The project explores how the temperature contrast has varied over the twentieth century in response to the different climate forcings between the northern and southern hemispheres, as well as other factors. It investigates temperature contrast variations on interannual timescales, as well as an abrupt climate event: a sharp decrease in the north-south hemispheric temperature difference around 1970. A project aim is to attribute these changes to climate forcing factors by comparing the spatio-temporal signatures of historical and specific-forcing global climate model runs with observations. Another goal is to quantify the impacts of the temperature contrast on shifts in the latitude of the tropical rainfall bands over the twentieth century and in global climate model simulations of twenty-first century climate change. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language of Taiwan. The project will foster fruitful collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley, and the Academia Sinica, Taipei. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the research project aims to develop insight into twentieth-century and projected future climate change at hemispheric and regional scales. In particular, a goal is to develop understanding of shifts in tropical rainfall that may affect water resources and agriculture in marginal regions. The Fellow plans to communicate the project results to climate impacts research community and make the findings publicly available online.

The project title is "Testing Applied Amphibian Conservation Methodologies." The host scientist is Dr. David Bickford.<br/><br/>The term "translocation" is used to describe any anthropogenically caused movement of living organisms from one area to another. Amphibian conservation programs utilize translocations for endangered species reintroductions, habitat mitigations, species restoration, and rehabilitations. However, little research has studied the subsequent behavioral and physiological effects on amphibians following translocation. This project focuses on 3 goals: 1) developing a long term research plan to develop tropical amphibian translocation experiments that can be replicated on temperate amphibians; 2) performing short translocation trails comparing methodologies on a common leaf litter frog; 3) initiating testing to assess a non-invasive attachment technique for radio transmitters that will eventually be used to track amphibians.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

The project title is "Comparison of Food Web Models Constructed with Traditional and Passive Sampling Data." The host scientist is Dr. Barry Kelly.<br/><br/>Food web modeling, which allows for the prediction of chemical concentrations in biota based on concentrations measured in sediments, water, or air, is often used for remediation decisions and to establish cleanup goals for contaminated sites. Yet, the accuracy of the model is dependent on how well the contamination is characterized. Traditional sediment sampling techniques often incorrectly estimate the concentration of contaminants that are readily accumulated by biota, which is referred to as the bioavailable fraction. However, passive samplers, constructed of a polymeric material, can act as surrogate for biota and have been shown to be a more accurate estimate of the bioavailable concentration. This research uses contaminant concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, measured using both traditional and passive sampling techniques, in a Gobas food web model to compare the outcomes as well as evaluate the impact these sampling techniques have on the model.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, results from this research could lead to innovation in the way contaminated sediment sites are evaluated and remediated. Findings will be presented to parties involved in the remediation of Superfund sites as well as graduate and undergraduate students at MIT.

Abstract: This action funds Jesse P. Angle of The University of California at Irvine to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 in the Crystal Interface Laboratory at The University of Tokyo in Tokyo, Japan. The project title is "In-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy Indentation to Characterize Deformation in Ceramics." The host scientist is Professor Yuichi Ikuhara. <br/><br/>This project focuses on determining the deformation mechanism in a widely used ceramic material, mullite. Even with its uses in the aerospace and electronics industries, many of the essential mechanical properties of this material still remain unknown and by understanding the fundamental deformation mechanism of slip, both the slip direction and slip-system, a complete characterization of the mechanical properties of mullite can be achieved. In order to observe the dislocation formation necessary to study the slip system of mullite, an in-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) piezo actuator controlled nano indenter is used to form indentations on the surface of a single crystal mullite sample to create plastic deformation region and create localized dislocations. By analyzing the reciprocal lattice vector (g) of the planes that diffract electrons under a two-beam condition (meaning one set of planes satisfies Bragg's Law), the Burgers vector (b) of the dislocation can be characterized. Matching this slip direction to the orientation of the crystal, the slip plane and thus the slip system can be determined. Understanding the limits of commonly used materials, allows the design, manufacture and implementation of critical engineering compounds with a much higher degree of success and reliability. This project has potential to see direct impact in the aerospace and electronics sectors where material advances drive the industry. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.

Being active in both academic and research focused outreach groups, this EAPSI Fellow plans to share his experiences in the NSF EASPI program by showing students, graduate and undergraduate, how international collaboration can be beneficial to their careers as scientists and engineers.

Abstract: This action funds Emily Marshall of Vanderbilt University to conduct a research project in Mathematics during the summer of 2013 at Monash University in Clayton, Victoria, Australia. The project title is "Novel Concepts in Graph Theory." The host scientist is David Wood.<br/><br/>The project focuses on several problems in the area of graph minor theory with a particular emphasis on Hamiltonicity. A graph is a set of vertices together with a set of edges which connect some pairs of vertices. A graph H is said to be a minor of a graph G if H can be formed from G by deleting and contracting edges of G. A graph is called Hamiltonian if it contains a cycle which passes through every vertex of the graph exactly once. A graph is called k-connected if the removal of any set of k-1 vertices in the graph never disconnects the graph. The project examines 3-connected graphs with no K2,t minors in regards to Hamiltonicity (where K2,t is the complete bipartite graph with partition sets of size 2 and t), and also looks for a characterization of all K2,5-minor free graphs since a characterization of all K2,4-minor free graphs is already in preparation. In addition, it seeks to determine the minimal forbidden minors of a specific class of minor-closed graphs in which every minor of every graph is subhamiltonian planar. A graph is subhamiltonian planar if it is the spanning subgraph of a planar Hamiltonian graph, and a class of graphs is minor-closed if every minor of every graph in the class is also in the class. A graph is planar if it can be drawn on the plane without crossing edges. Finally, the project examines a conjecture due to Barnette and Goodey involving the Hamiltonicity of 3-connected planar graphs with certain face size restrictions. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action is funding Ben Vander Jagt of The Ohio State University to conduct a research project in Geosciences during the summer of 2013 at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. The project title is "Estimating Snow Depth Remotely Using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle." The host scientist is Dr. Arko Lucieer, Senior Lecturer in Remote Sensing and GIS at the University of Tasmania.<br/><br/>This Fellowship is working on accurately estimating spatially continuous snow depth fields, using a combined Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and photographic based approach on-board an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). By measuring a geographic area once before the onset of the snow season and once again during the snow season, the Fellow can effectively determine both the amount and distribution of the snow contained within that area. It is the first time that a study of such nature has been performed, and is an excellent example of the novel scientific research that can be achieved using UAVs. Additionally, because a large percentage of the world's population depends on snow as a source of freshwater, being able to accurately measure and quantify snow accumulation is an important objective that has both scientific and civil merit. By providing resource managers with better information to facilitate effective water management, conflict between individuals as well as governmental organizations can be mitigated.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this Fellowship also provides an exciting opportunity to promote earth science and engineering within the general population, specifically secondary educational institutions. The Fellow plans to demonstrate the scientific capabilities of UAVs to local high schools in order to captivate and encourage students to pursue opportunities in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). The Fellow will make all data collected during the study freely available to the public, as well as any scientific publications which are authored as a result of the Fellowship. Lastly, attending the host country supplies the Fellow with a rich introduction to the science policy and legislation associated with the scientific and commercial use of UAVs, and provides an excellent cultural and scientific learning environment for conducting advanced research.

Abstract: This action funds Walter Varhue of the University of Virginia to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Academia Sinica in Nangang District, Taipei City, Taiwan. The project title is "The Development of a Microfluidic Device for the Detection of Low Concentrations of Ribonucleic Acid Biomarkers." The host scientist is Professor Chiafu Chao.<br/><br/>This projected develops a microfluidic device for the sub pM amperometric detection of Ribonucleic acid biomarkers utilizing a redox cycle and a nano-slit platform. The use of a nano-slit platform for this device lowers the sample to answer assay time through the limitation of the potential diffusion lengths and the electro-kinetic pre-concentration of the target biomarker. The signal current produced by this device is also amplified through the use of a redox cycle. The integration of these techniques in a single device achieves a great improvement in the ability to detect biomarkers at a fM dilution. Furthermore, through device characterization, the diffusion of particles confined by nano-scale geometry and its effect on electro-chemical detection will be able to be studied. This improved detection ability will eventually allow for faster diagnosis of possible infections and easier detection of infectious materials in an environment. Its inclusion on a Lab-on-a-chip style microfluidic device will also allow for miniaturization of this process allowing for greater portability. The development of detection methods capable of discerning the viability, infectivity, and speciation of infectious micro-organisms is a healthcare priority for early diagnosis of infection and routine monitoring for infectious material. The device proposed in this research project will facilitate an improvement of such methods through the sub pM amperometric detection of Ribonucleic acid biomarkers. The use of such a proposed device will lead not only to greater ability to detect and diagnosis pathogens but also may lead to the miniaturization of such technologies. Portability will enable easier and faster detection of potential health hazards.<br/><br/>Broder impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Joseph Byrnes of the University of Oregon to conduct a research project in Geoscience during the summer of 2013 at the Earthquake Research Institute, University of Tokyo in Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo. The project title is "Using Recordings of Distant Earthquakes to Measure the Thickness of Tectonic Plates." The host scientist is Professor Hitoshi Kawakatsu.<br/><br/>It has recently been shown that a sharp discontinuity in seismic velocity exists at the bottom of tectonic plates in the ocean. This discontinuity is postulated to distinguish the rigid plate (the 'Lithosphere') from the underlying convective mantle (the 'Asthenosphere'). The reason the discontinuity exists is poorly understood. This project aims to measure the depth of the discontinuity with plate age using ocean bottom seismometers located on the Juan De Fuca Plate, just off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. Since the discontinuity is sharp, P and S waves from distant events convert into one another when passing through the plate. The difference in arrival time, due to the lower velocity of S waves, between the direct and converted phases gives the depth to the discontinuity. Using this technique, the evolution of this enigmatic boundary can be established. Several competing theories have been put forward to explain why this discontinuity exists. The simplest hypothesis is that the plate thickness grows as the square root of its age, as predicted by models of a plate growing by conductive cooling. The most likely alternative is that the discontinuity has constant depth and is independent of age, which would likely represented a plate defined by the removal of water from the mantle when the plate is created, forming a rigid body that defines the tectonic plate.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Beatrix Dudzik of the University of Tennessee to conduct a research project in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at the Kyushu University Museum located at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan. The project title is "Examining Cranial Variation in Japanese Skeletal Samples Using Three Dimensional Data." The host scientist is Dr. Noriko Seguchi.<br/><br/>Collection of metric skeletal data in countries where data is not well represented within the academic literature is imperative for the advancement of biological and forensic anthropology. Procurement and curation of this type of information provides a means for both burgeoning and seasoned researchers to address hypotheses that have both broad and focused implications for scientific communities. This project explores cranial morphometrics by collecting three dimensional landmark data which can be used to provide further insight into an array of topics including how functional modules within the cranium are affected by factors such as migration patterns and adaptation. Specifically, this study examines morphological variation of the human cranium in Japanese populations across a broad temporal span. This study is the first to record and analyze three dimensional landmark data of the human skull from a large Japanese skeletal sample that dates from the Yayoi period to the modern Edo period. Analyses of the data collected investigate the hypothesis that morphological patterns of a range of skeletal samples from various temporal depths can be used to infer evolutionary patterns within East Asia.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the data collected for this study will be added to the Forensic Databank of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Tennessee, which is available to researchers and graduate students at accredited national and international laboratories and universities to promote skeletal research in the field of biological and forensic anthropology. The prospect of adding a vast dataset of an underrepresented population to a growing U.S database offers direct benefits for assisting biological and forensic anthropologists in formulation of an accurate biological profile for unidentified remains, ultimately aiding law enforcement in reducing missing person's lists. In addition, building international relationships with professionals in the field of biological anthropology and anatomy is invaluable as it promotes research collaboration and adds to the broad ranging goal of collecting biological data in all geographic regions of the world, which has large implications for skeletal research conducted in the United States, as this country is comprised of populations from around the world. Ultimately, establishing academic rapport with international agencies provides foundations for future opportunity for both American and international researchers to travel and network in foreign countries with the common goal of education, collaboration and global scientific advancement.

Abstract: This action funds Ian Johnston of Boston University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at Kyoto University's Institute for Chemical Research in Kyoto. The project title is "Developing Latent Genotypes for Genome-Wide Association Studies." The host scientist is Professor Hiroshi Mamitsuka.<br/><br/>This research project rigorously vets a new technique for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that combines a Bayesian statistical model with a novel concept of a "latent genotype" in an attempt to: formally address rare variants and linkage disequilibrium in GWAS data; and to exploit the underlying structure of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to then identify associations between SNPs and genes and diseases. The latent genotypes are obtained by transforming the original genotypes in such a way so as to correct for the strong correlation present in the data. In order to justify the use of the latent genotypes in GWAS, an additional goal of the project is to conduct a comparative analysis of current Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods using the original genotypes versus the latent genotypes. The product of this research project is an extensive comparative analysis that first investigates the usefulness of the latent genotypes and then investigates the usefulness of the novel Bayesian statistical model for GWAS, as well as software that implements the proposed model.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the software to be produced by this research project can be used by industry professionals as well as in teaching examples. In particular, the cross-fertilization of ideas between statisticians and geneticists would be especially fruitful in establishing groundwork for future mutual projects as well as for the networks of communication that are ultimately necessary to achieve the overall goals of genetic studies.

Abstract: This action funds Roo Vandegrift of the University of Oregon's Institute of Ecology and Evolution to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. The project title is "Dispersal Ecology of a Common Family of Leaf-Inhabiting Fungi (Xylariaceae)." The host scientist is Dr. Yu-Ming Ju.<br/><br/>The role of xylariaceous fungi as endophytes remains unclear, as do many aspects of their lifecycle, such as their means of dispersal. It has been proposed that these may be linked: xylariaceous fungi could utilize the endophytic life stage as a means to "forage" for an appropriate substrate, persisting longer in the environment as an infected leaf than they could as a naked spore. This theory has never been adequately tested. This project looks for evidence of dispersal limitation in xylariaceous endophytes to test the hypothesis that the endophytic life stage of Xylariaceae serves as a means of dispersal within the family. Dr. Yu-Ming Ju has helped create a history of collaboration between East and West centered around the study of this group of fungi. This is worth preserving in new generations of mycologists and ecologists. Scientific collaboration across geography and culture is one of the factors that continually pushes forward our quest for knowledge. The importance of understanding biological diversity cannot be understated. We are in the midst of a mass extinction event, and in many cases species are lost whose significance is unknown. Understanding the ecology of this group of fungus is crucial in a world with a rapidly changing climate, accelerating tropical deforestation, and increasing trans-continental trade in plants which may be harboring cryptic fungal partners. Understanding the roles and relationships of fungal endophytes may allow us to ameliorate some of the species loss due to climate change and deforestation.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, in addition to this utility for conservation efforts, this project may also provide valuable information to foresters attempting to control pathogens in timber lands.

The project title is "Analyzing Single Cells from Unculturable Samples." The host scientist is Professor Peng Liu.<br/><br/>Relatively few unculturable species of bacteria have been discovered and sequenced due to conventional approaches that require many cells from "clonal" cultures. A Lab-on-a-Chip device has proven the concept to identify some known species of bacteria from a mixed population of uncultured bacteria by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and flow cytometry integration (FlowFISH). This project integrates on-chip cell sorting to FlowFISH that attempts to isolate a targeted uncultured single cell for polymeric chain reaction (PCR) characterization. This project will allow quick and direct detection of bacteria that appear in uncultured samples, such as water, soil, or different clinical samples from the human body. The benefits to society may include quicker response to bacterial contamination in the environment and elucidation of the relationship between disease and human microbiome.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

The project title is "Evaluating the Transgenic Applications of Mobile DNA in Human Pluripotent Stem cells." The host scientist is Dr. Knut Woltjen.<br/><br/>Transgenics, delivering engineered genes stably into a target cell's genome, is a mainstay of functional genomics. For proper function, gene-trap transgenesis requires that an engineered vector integrates into the correct portion of a gene. Despite this requirement current gene-trapping methods proceed with little or no empirical knowledge of integration profiles, thereby limiting the efficiency of the approach. This study bioinformatically evaluates the integration profiles of transposons which are commonly used for integration and then couple each transposon with the best possible gene-trap. The successful completion of this project will result in a system of transgenic tools that are highly efficient for integration in human stem cells. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Lauren Wheeler of the University of Maine to conduct a research project in Geosciences during the summer of 2013 at GNS Science in Lower Hutt, Wellington, New Zealand. The project title is "Modeling the Effects of Glaciation from the Last Glacial Maximum to Present on Mountain Building in the Central South Island of New Zealand." The host scientist is Dr. Phaedra Upton.<br/><br/>This project is examining the effects of glacial mass loading and unloading on the tectonics of New Zealand's central South Island using three-dimensional numerical modeling. The South Island is a highly-studied region, and the tectonics and glacial-interglacial periods are well constrained by both field observations and numerical models. These models give us the opportunity to develop a sense of how glaciation affects mountain building (topography and changes in strain) from the Last Glacial Maximum to present. Work of this kind is ongoing for southeast Alaska. The size of the glacial load on the South Island is comparable to those in Alaska. New Zealand and southeast Alaska are both tectonically active regions and comparing the two will develop a sense of how glaciation affects mountain building in multiple mountain ranges. Due to the spatial variation in both New Zealand and southeast Alaska, it is not sufficient to model these systems using a single two-dimensional cross section (as is often done) through the mountain range to represent the mechanics. This is especially inaccurate in a region where the mechanics are influenced by glaciation as glaciers vary in their spatial extent and thickness. Modeling the influence of glaciation on tectonics in three-dimensions is not only a new addition to the scientific literature and community but more accurately represents the region.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Benjamin Thomas Fine of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University to conduct a research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at the Australian Centre for Field Robotics at the University of Sydney in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The project title is "Manipulating Migratory Motions of Flocks of Birds: A Computational Exploration." The host scientist is Dr. Salah Sukkarieh.<br/><br/>Many groups of agents, such as birds, fish, and locust, exhibit emergent collective behaviors (e.g., schooling fish and locust migratory band formation). The environment in which the agents operate is one determinant of the resulting behaviors. Using unmanned aerial vehicles to monitor the migratory motions of the swift parrot in New South Wales, Australia, this investigation attempts to identify which properties of the agents' environment influence the exhibited behaviors of the parrot flocks. The Fellow developed an approach for the generation of environments that elicit a pre-specified behavior from a given group of agents. This approach is used to explore how different environmental properties can be used to manipulate the migratory motions of the parrots. Moreover, the data collected from the field will be used to refine the geometrical theory and computational implementation, which can be used for investigating other agents and collective behaviors (e.g., migratory motions of locust bands and evacuation behaviors of pedestrians). The computational implementation developed for this investigation along with empirical data collected from the field, will allow the PI to explore the possibility of effectively manipulating collectives by altering their environment. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the understanding of the environmental properties that effect group behaviors could also be applied to effective manipulation of Australian Plague Locust migratory bands, which has the potential to affect the livelihoods of one in ten people throughout the world. Moreover, this work would also be useful for applications in livestock/poultry management, the study of emergent behaviors, and assisting in improving the efficiency of building evacuations.

The project title is "Soot Characterization in a Wood-Burning Cookstove Using Laser-Induced Incandescence." The host scientists are Professors Paul Medwell and Cristian Birzer.<br/><br/>Four million people die every year from exposure to sooty biomass fires. In attempts to mitigate this health risk, researchers are developing improved cookstoves to reduce the production of harmful emissions, like soot, from cooking fires. Laser diagnostic techniques, such as laser-induced incandescence, can characterize the soot formation and distribution patterns in a fire. In this project, laser-induced incandescence is used to analyze the combustion in the Berkeley-Darfur Stove, an improved wood-burning cookstove, to identify particularly sooty regions in the flame zone and suggest locations for modifications to diminish soot formation. Soot formation in cookstoves has never been visualized with laser-induced incandescence before, so this project has a realistic potential of producing new, unique, and useful data to both the cookstove and combustion science communities.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the laser diagnostic techniques examined in this project could be applied to any number of cookstoves, and the understanding of how and where soot forms in a cookstove would allow for modifications to reduce the production of soot, decreasing the substantial health risks of biomass cooking for nearly 3 billion people worldwide.

Abstract: This action funds Douglas Smith of Michigan Technological University to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Beijing Institute of Technology in Beijing, China. The project title is "Nanoparticle-based Fluorescent Sensors for Measurement of Acidic Intracellular pH in Living Cells." The host scientist is Dr. Si-ping Pang.<br/><br/>Intracellular pH plays many critical roles in cell, enzyme and tissue activities, including proliferation and apoptosis, ion transport, endocytosis, and muscle contraction. Cellular dysfunction is often associated with abnormal pH values in organelles (mitochondria, lysosomes, etc.). Monitoring pH changes inside living cells is also important for studying cellular internalization pathways, such as phagocytosis, endocytosis, and receptor ligand internalization. The Fellow synthesized a series of new fluorescent sensors in his home lab (Michigan Tech. Univ.). Several features of the sensors (absence of cytotoxicity, high cell permeability, and long-lived intracellular fluorescence) make the pH sensors superior candidates for examining intracellular pH alterations in intact cells. Other commercially available pH sensors do not exhibit these features. Accordingly, the sensors offer novel experimental opportunities for live-imaging in intact cells over multiple time points (hours), and thus add a new tool in understanding intracellular alterations in normal and cancerous cell growth. The easily accessible terminal alkyne/ azido "clickable" function groups of these sensors offer the possibility of rapidly constructing sensor molecule libraries using "click" chemistry. This project exploits this approach to prepare multiple nanoparticle-based fluorescent sensors. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Hui-Yiing Chang of Vanderbilt University to conduct a research project in MPS during the summer of 2013 at Korea Astronomy and Space Sciences Institute in Daejeon. The project title is "Testing the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe Effect in Different Models of the Universe." The host scientist is Dr Yong-Seon Song.<br/><br/>Dark energy forms anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, resulting in the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. The ISW-LSS (Large Scale Structure) cross-correlation function, which shows the ISW effect on large angular scales, is derived. Relevant data from the nine-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe observations and the Planck mission results are employed, and the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System used to perform integration in the process. In conclusion, the ISW effect on the Viscous Dark Fluid cosmology, which will likely produce strong ISW signals, and the Inflection Point Quintessence cosmology, which will likely produce the opposite kind, is tested.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, a paper about the research results targeting physics amateurs will be disseminated to a broad audience, including through a non-technical journal. Presentation of the research will be proposed at national and international general science and interdisciplinary conferences that even involve the arts disciplines. Coordination will be made with the Society of Physics Students at the author's home institution for launching an outreach program in the Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools (MNPS) in Nashville, TN to make presentations at the 21 high schools and other schools where high school students are enrolled, which include the Baxter and Cohn Alternative Learning Centers, the MNPS Virtual School and the Cohn Adult High School. The students will be introduced to the mystery of dark energy and its pivotal stance. Then, the rest of the research will be presented in a systematic fashion through visual materials. Due to the ethnic and socio-economic demographics of the student population in MNPS, a significant number of under-represented minorities in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields will be reached.

Abstract: This action funds Richard Vallett of Drexel University to conduct a research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at Hubo Lab at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Deajeon, South Korea. The project title is "Kinematics of Humanoid Robot Vehicle Operation." The host scientist is Dr. Jun-Ho Oh.<br/><br/>This research project develops a kinematic joint controller to enable the humanoid robot, Hubo2+ KHR-4 (Hubo), to operate a small utility vehicle as required for the 2013 DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC). This project involves analyzing the kinematics of rotating the steering wheel and pressing the foot pedals of a golf cart, simulating the desired steering and throttling/braking motions using the Hubo virtual model (openHubo) and virtual vehicle model, and verifying the planned motion using the Hubo and physical hardware. This approach allows the DRC driving team to correlate the desired linear and angular velocities of the golf cart to the Hubo's joint movements to effectively control the vehicle during the first DRC event. Further research tasks involve updating the dimensions and mass properties of the Hubo Computer Aided Design (CAD) model to develop a more complete 3D model, which will be reflected in the improved accuracy of the openHubo model used by affiliated DRC teams working on related competition tasks. The outcome of this research will immediately benefit engineers and DRC affiliates working with Hubo platforms in the United States on humanoid motion planning.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the knowledge gained from working with humanoid researchers at Hubo Lab will be documented and shared with students working at the Drexel Autonomous Systems Lab (DASL) and affiliated research labs and will be used to instruct students on proper operation and maintenance of the Hubo platform. The revisions made to the Hubo CAD model will be used to facilitate cooperation between universities by providing an accurate and standardized model in this concurrent engineering project. The improvements to the virtual Hubo model will aid researchers in accurately simulating and prototyping planned motions before testing with the physical Hubo. Ultimately, this research will assist in the adoption of the Hubo as a standardized platform used for humanoid research.

Abstract: This action funds Richard Galvez of Syracuse University to conduct a research project in MPS during the summer of 2013 at University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand. The project title is "What Happened Immediately after Cosmic Inflation? A Novel Analysis of the Unknown Era of the Expansion of the Universe." The host scientist is Professor Richard Easther.<br/><br/>Due to modern experiments such as NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the European Space Agency's Planck, the expansion history of the universe from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) era until today is very well understood to remarkable precision. The expansion history before BBN however is still a mystery. If one assumes cosmic inflation to take place in the very early universe (around a fraction of a second after the Big Bang) can experimental results from Planck and WMAP constrain what happened during this time? And, if so, to what extent? This is the question this project is addressing. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Upon return to Syracuse University, the Fellow will use the research and experience gained during the EAPSI fellowship to mentor two undergraduate students on a research project with the goal of introducing these students to modern practices in academic research and various topics in theoretical physics and cosmology. The Fellow will also organize an EAPSI workshop for other graduate students across STEM fields about his experiences and encourage others from Syracuse University to apply. The Fellow is also giving seminars at universities in NZ to disseminate information gathered in his project thus far. In addition, the Fellow plans to present research findings at academic conferences in the 2013-2014 academic year as well as as a series of seminars planned in Nicaragua.

Abstract: This action funds Pamela Allen of Oregon State University to conduct a research project in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Fu Jen University in Taipei, Taiwan. The project title is "Perceptions of Aging in Taiwan and the United States: Cross Cultural Differences in Domain Specific Attitudes." The host scientist is Zai-Ting Yeh, Ph.D. <br/><br/>Worldwide population aging is transforming gerontology into a globalized discipline and creating a context in which age discrimination could have significant human and economic costs. To examine the largely untested assumption that a collectivistic Asian culture promotes more positive attitudes toward aging, this project identifies differences in stereotypes of the elderly specific to certain life domains (e.g., social, cognitive, physical, financial, sexual) between older adults (65+) in Taiwan and older adults in the U.S. These perceptions of aging are being measured among older adults in the Taipei community using a mixed methods approach with both quantitative survey data and qualitative interview data. Identifying differences in the negativity of aging stereotypes in various life domains between Taiwan and the US helps determine the appropriateness of international translation of gerontological education programs aimed at ameliorating the negative impacts of negative aging stereotypes and ageism. This examination also identifies potential limitations to the goals of globalized gerontology, which promotes international translation of educational programs, and thereby also enhances an understanding of how to mobilize educational resources efficiently. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. The EAPSI Fellow is using first hand experience under the Taiwanese host mentor to build the skills necessary for effective cross cultural research in social science. The benefits of this experience are being passed on in the Fellow's mentoring activities with undergraduate research assistants at Oregon State University. In addition, the collaboration made possible by this fellowship allows the Fellow to include other Oregon State University graduate students in the developing an international research network. At the institutional level, participation in the EAPSI program is enabling the Fellow to assess the feasibility of establishing a lasting research partnership by introducing a research component to the existing student exchange program between the Fellow's host and home institutions (e.g., research assistantships for undergraduate students in Oregon State University's gerontology program). Beyond academic outlets, results of the EAPSI project are to be disseminated through the EAPSI Fellow's interdisciplinary research activities and engagement with the community as an NSF IGERT in Aging Sciences trainee.

Abstract: This action funds Jessamyn Schertz of the University of Arizona to conduct a research project in Linguistics during the summer of 2013 at the Hanyang Phonetics and Psycholinguistics Laboratory at Hanyang University in Seoul, Korea. The project title is "Native Language Influence on Second Language Sound Categories." The host scientist is Dr. Taehong Cho.<br/><br/>The proposed project examines how Korean listeners use different acoustic dimensions (voice onset time, stop closure duration, and pitch) to distinguish the three-way stop consonant contrast of Korean ([pul] 'fire' vs. [p*ul] 'horn' vs. [phul] 'grass'), as well as how these native language sound categories shape production and perception of the similar sound contrast ('pa' vs. 'ba') in English, their second language. The first set of experiments examines to what extent individual differences in native language 'cue weighting,' or the relative reliance on the different acoustic dimensions, correspond to differences in second language cue weighting (e.g. if a listener relies heavily on pitch to distinguish the contrast in Korean, they may be more likely to rely heavily on pitch when distinguishing the contrast in English as well, even though pitch is not a reliable cue for distinguishing the English contrast), as well as the stability of cue weighting strategies across speech perception and production. The second experiment explores factors contributing to the plasticity of these phonetic category boundaries (i.e. how easy it is to manipulate cue weighting strategies based on short-term training). The results of these studies will provide insight into the extent to which individuals differ in the structure and plasticity of sound categories in their native and second languages, as well as factors which influence responsiveness to training on foreign sound categories.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the project represents a two-way training opportunity in which the Fellow and the members of the lab at Hanyang University can share their different areas of expertise with one another in their collaborations, and in particular allows the Fellow to extend her dissertation research to a language that she would not otherwise be able to study in depth. The Fellow will disseminate the research at professional conferences, such that the results of the project, which should provide insight into how people learn foreign sound categories, will be made available to researchers working more directly on second language acquisition.

Previously, this sea lion has been considered closely related to the living and highly endangered Australian sea lion, a species currently restricted to Western Australia. However, rigorous comparisons of the skull of Neophoca palatina were not made to other fur seals or sea lions. This study re-examines the relationships of this species by rigorously comparing it to other southern hemisphere fur seals and sea lions using phylogenetic and morphometric techniques. This provides important insights into the former distribution of Neophoca as well as the evolution of sea lions in the Southern Hemisphere and provides important data for future research on seal and carnivore evolution<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

The project title is "The Importance of Microbial Interactions to Soil Carbon Cycling on a Warming Planet." The host scientist is Dr. Rota Wagai.<br/><br/>This project examines the effect of microbial interactions on changes to soil carbon dynamics in response to warming conditions using microcosms with naturally-occuring bacterial populations under different temperature treatments. Soil amoebae are abundant and ubiquitous bacterial predators that play an important, yet understudied, role in regulating bacterial populations, which are vastly important for global carbon cycling. Existing climate change models have begun to examine the functions that microbial communities may play in contributing to or mitigating global warming, but they do not yet include information about how total microbial community structure impacts these predictions. Common soil amoebae are used in replicates of intact sterilized soil cores along with inoculations of naturally-occuring bacteria in a full factorial experiment. Frequent measurements of carbon dioxide emissions allow an investigation of the importance of microbial predation and food web complexity on bacterially-mediated responses to climate change.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

The blog will document the experience of traveling to Japan and learning about Japanese culture, but will focus on the importance of international collaborations and cultural exchanges. It will be designed to engage students at a critical point in their education with the excitement of discovery and the scientific process, while sharing insights into another culture.

Abstract: This action funds James McKee of the University of Central Florida to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Suzhou Institute of Nanotechnology (SINANO) in Suzhou, China. The project title is "Processing of Continuously Drawn Yarn from Self-Aligned Carbon Nanotube Paper." The host scientist is Dr. Qingwen Li.<br/><br/>Carbon nanopaper (CNT) possesses many potential applications in composites and other uses, but a critical issue is the creation of production-scale aligned nanopaper. The alignment is key to producing controllable properties of the nanopaper that can be tailored to the intended application. This project investigates the nanotube fabric and yarn production practices in place at the sponsor institution, namely the drawing process used, and how it can be applied to the solution-filtration methodology currently practiced to produce in-plane aligned CNT papers and yarns. The degree of alignment and anisotropy between the drawn carbon nanotube yarns produced at Suzhou Institute of Nanotechnology (SINANO) is being compared with the randomly oriented solution-filtration produced nanopaper produced at the Fellow's home institution. The conceptual model gained from this study will ultimately be applied to the current process in use to produce continuous, aligned carbon nanopaper. Carbon nanotube paper and fabric have immediate applications in the aerospace industry for repairable electromagnetic shielding and lightning strike protection schemes for composite bodied aircraft that represent a vast improvement over the current metal-mesh techniques and can implemented with the composite manufacturing techniques that are already well-known in the aerospace industry. The weight savings these materials would allow for increased fuel efficiency in the transportation sector, improving vehicle performance in sector that affects everything from food prices to leisure air travel. With the improvements to conductivity, flame resistance, and static and dynamic mechanical properties created with standard, randomly oriented nanopaper, the ability to create continuous and even aligned nanopaper represents a new ability to use nanomaterials in large aerospace and structural applications more efficiently. The obvious industrial benefits are impressive, as is the long-term environmental effect as the efficiency increase would reduce vehicle emissions and part longevity. Additionally, the benefits of the integration of the nanopaper into wind turbines could potentially improve blade longevity, radar signature (many wind turbine farms are semi-invisible to radar), and lower lifetime operating costs.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Joshua Stepanek of the University of Colorado Boulder to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at Tokyo Gakugei University in Koganei, Tokyo. The project title is "Taxonomic and Phylogenetic Investigation of the Diatom Genus Amphora." The host scientist is Dr. Shigeki Mayama.<br/><br/>Diatoms are an important and diverse group of microalgae found in virtually all aquatic environments. Within diatoms, members of the genus Amphora have been singled out as a potentially important biofuels source due to their ability to naturally produce large amounts of cellular oil. Although shown to be promising, the diversity and evolutionary history of the group continues to be poorly understood, undermining its potential usefulness. Preliminary data has shown Amphora to be a collection of distantly related subgroups, widely distributed throughout the diatom tree of life. This project continues an investigation into the taxonomy and evolutionary history of the genus Amphora, utilizing both the unique flora of Japan, as well as the expertise of Japanese diatom researchers. These goals are being met through the targeted collection of known Amphora populations, followed by the isolation and culturing of Amphora taxa present. From these collections, an evolutionary tree is being constructed using morphological and molecular techniques. Collaborative outcomes include: the description and publication of new species encountered during collections; the most extensively sampled phylogeny to date for the genus Amphora; and insights into the evolution of important lineages and characteristics within diatoms.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. The unique experience of conducting research in Japan will be disseminated through departmental seminars at the University of Colorado. These will highlight the research conducted, as well as the cultural experience obtained through an EAPSI fellowship to a broad group of young researchers who could benefit from a similar experience. Furthermore outcomes from this study provide an ideal example of "real world" applications of evolutionary research and will have broader impacts outside the scientific community. Through public outreach programs of the Evolution Outreach Committee at the University of Colorado, this research will provide an opportunity to bring evolution out of the laboratory and demonstrate its practical importance in an accessible way to a general public audience. Relating how ongoing evolutionary research effects people?s everyday lives and is closely tied to practical problems and decision marking is an important component of this evolutionary study.

Abstract: This action funds Rex Lundgren of the University of Texas at Austin to conduct a research project in the Math and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at The University of Tokyo Institute for Solid State Physics in Tokyo, Japan. The project title is "Entanglement Spectrum of Metallic Systems." The host scientists are Dr. Masaki Oshikawa and Dr. Shunsuke Furukawa.<br/><br/>The proposed project is to theoretically calculate the entanglement spectrum of metallic condensed matter systems, i.e. systems without an energy gap in their band structure. The entanglement spectrum and possible entanglement applications of these systems have not been well explored. In insulating systems, the entanglement spectrum has provided a wealth of information and applications. In particular, the entanglement spectrum allows one to identify topological systems of matter, such as a topological insulators or the fractional quantum hall states, from just the ground state wave function. This theoretical calculation is being done with a combination of powerful non-perturbative and perturbative analytics and numerics, on which the host scientists at the University of Tokyo are world renowned experts. Studying the entanglement spectrum of metallic systems allows one to better understand strongly correlated condensed matter systems and investigate the potential entanglement applications of these interesting systems, which could lead to wide ranging broader impacts outside the physics community.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the Fellow will submit this research in a paper to a leading condensed matter journal and to to submit a poster on the work for the Mathematical Statistical Physics conference in Kyoto, Japan in July 2013. Upon his return, the Fellow plans to give a talk to the local undergraduate physics club about the experience in Japan and why studying the entanglement spectrum is important. The talk will focus on the experience in Japan and the broader impacts of the entanglement spectrum and physics in general. In addition, the Fellow plans to give talks about the experience to a few local high schools, especially those with a large number of minority students.

Due to the significant opportunity for advances in aeroacoustics research that such a test section affords, Virginia Tech's Stability Wind Tunnel has developed a high fidelity method to a priori correct pressure data for lift interference and blockage that employs a panel method simulation derived entirely from first principles and independently measured physical properties. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Low Speed Wind Tunnel has also developed a correction method, but it derives from a different basis than that established at the Stability Wind Tunnel. The current research aims to join aerodynamic data from both wind tunnels to produce a unified method for correcting pressure data in porous-walled, hybrid anechoic test sections. Another impact of the research trip is the collaboration produced between Virginia Tech Tech's Stability Wind Tunnel and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, both of which organizations are on the forefront of aerodynamics and aeroacoustics research. Given that these two tunnels are yet the only two wind tunnels worldwide to employ the hybrid test section, this research collaboration provides an opportunity to direct the course of aeroacoustics research by establishing a unified aerodynamic correction method for hybrid test sections. An accurate evaluation of the aerodynamic characteristics of such test sections, when combined with the simultaneous measurement of detailed acoustic data that such test sections afford, provides unique opportunities in the development of wind turbine blades, high-speed trains, aircraft, automobiles, submarines, and other new and old technologies. In each of these fields, the balance between high performance aerodynamics and low noise emission acoustics must be struck with precision. Incorporating these two aspects of wind tunnel measurement into one test section has widespread benefits and attracts research interest from leading world research organizations such as NASA, DLR, and ONERA. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the results of the research will be disseminated through both the Fellow's thesis and additional publications and seminars by the Fellow. Through these means, it is feasible to think that hybrid test sections may emerge as the next generation wind tunnel configuration, broadening the research capability of the aeroacoustics community.

Abstract: This action funds Lauren Dell Zarzar of Harvard University to conduct a research project in the Math and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. The project title is Self-Assembly of Mechanically-Responsive Liquid Crystals within Deformable Substrates." The host scientist is Professor Takashi Kato.<br/><br/>For many materials where there exists a strong structure-function relationship, the process of directed self-assembly shows great promise as a general approach by which to influence materials properties via the control of nanoscale order. Self-assembly of liquid crystals, as well as other materials, is a sensitive dynamic process and the resulting assembled structure is affected by tunable external and internal parameters, one of which is the new surface interactions resulting from geometric confinement. Specifically, this project focuses on the assembly of luminescent liquid crystals within flexible nano/microscale 3D-patterned surfaces. The color of luminescence of this particular class of liquid crystals is sensitive to the self-assembled structure of the molecules. This project therefore focuses on 1) how certain surface and geometric parameters affect initial assembly order/color of the liquid crystals within confinement and 2) how subsequent changes in these geometric parameters (such as by substrate deformation) may trigger reorganization of the liquid crystal molecules into a new self-assembled structure with different properties. The ability to use rationally designed confining surfaces to externally trigger a material's self-reorganization/assembly could lead to the development of a novel, transformative class of "smart" materials capable of adapting to external pressures via self-assembling mechanisms. The development of numerous "smart" materials could impact every-day life, including wearable technologies, self-camouflaging surfaces, and tamper-reporting labels. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the results of this research will be disseminated through presentation, publication, and public outreach programs, including the development of a hands-on demonstration that will introduce young students to the concepts of liquid crystals and self-assembly.

Abstract: This action funds Samuel Fuller Dodge of Arizona State University to conduct a research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at Peking University in Beijing, China. The project title is "Biologically Inspired Computer Vision: Using Attention to Efficiently Process Visual Entities." The host scientist is Dr. Yizhou Wang.<br/><br/>This project studies the usefulness of biologically inspired visual attention models in computer vision applications. The human visual system is able to process a large amount of information using relatively few physiological resources by selectively focusing attention on the most salient areas of a scene. This same manner of information processing can be useful in computer vision systems that are under similar computational constraints. To this aim, this project investigates the relative influence of simple bottom-up attention and more complicated top-down attention for the applications of object recognition and scene understanding. Bottom-up attention is formed from low-level features that attract our attention such as a red dot in a sea of blue dots. Top-down attention stems from higher level cognitive processing, such as detecting a face in the scene. Together these two factors can yield a more appropriate attention model for use in computer vision recognition tasks.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the results of this research will be disseminated in a top computer vision conference, so that this research can find use in practical application areas such as automation, healthcare, and intelligent systems. The fellow is working with Chinese graduate and undergraduate students to improve their professional English, so that they will be more prepared for conferences.

Abstract: This action funds Rory Walsh of University of Oregon to conduct a research project in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Chungbuk National University in Cheongju, Chungcheongbuk-do, Republic of Korea. The project title is "Ancient State Formation in Korea: Ceramic Production, Consumption, and Exchange in the Baekje Kingdom." The host scientist is Dr. SEONG JeongYong.<br/><br/>Using previously excavated materials from the archaeological archives at Chungbuk National University, this project investigates the role of pottery and food systems in the formation of the Baekje kingdom. Baekje was the first state-level society in the southwestern Korean peninsula, and served as a nexus of trade and cultural exchange among contemporary peoples in mainland and insular East Asia. This makes Baekje an excellent case study for economic and agricultural processes in the development of complex political systems, with ramifications for the worldwide study of state formation. Neutron Activation Analysis helps determine geochemical sources for clays, revealing continuity and change in systems of production, and chemical residue analysis identifies patterns in food use for ritual or symbolic purposes, as well as everyday subsistence. The archaeology of Korea presents a particularly vital and productive venue for international collaboration. Korean studies, including art, media, language, and history are currently enjoying a meteoric rise among international students and scholars. While this has led many to describe Korea as "emergent" on the world stage, the archaeology of Korea belies this label, demonstrating the pivotal role of Peninsular societies in shaping the collective culture of East Asia for at least the last three millennia. Archaeology provides an essential perspective to the study of Korean culture, by allowing us to track the uniqueness of Korean ways of life as well as to examine the curatorial role played by Korea in transmitting various technological, social, and artistic innovations across East Asia.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, Korean archaeology is underrepresented in English language literature, although domestic research in South Korea is impressively meticulous and thorough. The Fellow's research also advances realignment of archaeological goals with the concerns of local communities. This project deploys state-of-the-art analytical techniques with a collaborative international sensibility, and will produce lasting, mutually beneficial cooperation between the institutions and researchers involved.

Abstract: This action funds Dana Dolan of George Mason University to conduct an interdisciplinary research project in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, ACT. The project title is "Governance for Climate Change Adaptation in Complex, Crossboundary, Social-Ecological Systems." The host scientist is Professor Stephen R. Dovers, Director of ANU's Fenner School of Environment and Society.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to understand the evolution of institutional arrangements for long-term governance, in theory and in practice. Climate change is a scientifically and socially complex challenge marked by irreducible uncertainty, very long feedback cycles and significant variation at the local scale. Adaptation will require coordination and collaboration across multiple institutional boundaries and across multiple sectors. These requirements present novel challenges to traditional, hierarchical approaches to governing as well as to decentralized market approaches; networked governance theories may help explain emerging decision-making structures. This study responds to calls from the climate change research community for empirical research that analyzes place-based adaptation and that extends existing work in the natural sciences to incorporate social sciences through a qualitative case study of the public policy networks in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) region in southeast Australia, an ecologically rich, politically fragmented, and institutionally diverse Social-Ecological System (SES). Furthermore, this research may provide insights for the literature on institutional change, broadly defined. Traditional theories such as punctuated equilibrium have provided a wealth of insight into how institutional change occurs-or is resisted-in complex public policy areas: governance through reaction to crises. However, the long-term crisis of climate change threatens to produce events ("punctuations") with unacceptable consequences in terms of human suffering. Developing alternative models of institutional change that support proactive approaches to long-term governance issues may help reduce these negative consequences.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Results of this study will be documented in a research report suitable for peer-reviewed publication. Findings will also be presented at national conferences and local seminars or workshops in both Australia and the United States with the aim of furthering cross-national policy learning and collaborative scholarship.

Abstract: This action funds Kelly Spendlove of Montana State University to conduct a research project in the Math and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan. The project is entitled "Computing the Signatures of Critical Transitions Arising in a Complex System." The host scientist is Hiroshi Kokubu. <br/><br/>Complex dynamical systems, which range from physiological systems and financial markets to models of the Earth's climate, often exhibit critical thresholds - commonly entitled tipping points - at which the system may radically shift its behavior from one state to another. For instance, in physiology, there are spontaneous systemic failures such as asthma attacks or epileptic seizures, as well as the sudden onset and progression of certain diseases; in ecology there is the collapse of wildlife populations or catastrophic desertification of environments; in the Earth climate system, abrupt shifts in ocean circulation or climate may occur. It is notoriously difficult to predict such critical transitions before they happen: empirically, systems may show little change before reaching a tipping point; theoretically, it has been proven that changes in global dynamics can occur on all scales in both phase space and parameter space. Moreover, models of complex systems are typically imprecise, parameters are rarely known exactly and computations may contain errors of various magnitudes. In spite of this difficulty, recent work now suggests the existence of generic early-warning signals, not specific to any particular class of system. Utilizing such generic indicators, this project implements a novel form of analysis, based on ideas from dynamical systems theory and applied algebraic topology, aiming to uncover the fundamental characteristics - or signature - of critical transitions before they occur.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, all developed code is being incorporated within an existing open-source project with which the host scientist is currently involved. The emphasis on an open-source framework in this project is particularly important, since as part of an on-going website and source-code repository the results of the work are publicly available, unhindered by academic institution, monetary cost and even scientific discipline.

Abstract: This action funds Tyler Anthony Pritchard of The Pennsylvania State University to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at the Kavli Institute for Physics and Mathematics of the Universe in Kashiwa, Chiba at the University of Tokyo Campus. The project title is "Modeling the Ultraviolet Properties of the Death of Massive Stars." The host scientists are Ken Nomoto and Keiichi Maeda.<br/><br/>Core-Collapse Supernovae are the result of a massive star exploding at the final age of its stellar evolution. These cosmic explosions are extremely important as our understanding of them influences a number of astrophysical subfields in addition to that of particle and plasma physics at high energies. This project incorporates Ultraviolet (UV) light observations--important at early times but are rare and difficult to obtain--into cutting edge numerical models of these explosions in order to increase the understanding of these astrophysical events and the stars that create them. In concert with the recent unparalleled UV observations of the supernova 2012aw by the NASA Swift space telescope and supporting ground-based optical and near-infrared multi-wavelength observations, this enhanced code is used to examine the properties of this stellar explosion. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Agnieszka Szymanska of the Center for Biomedical Signal Processing and Computation, University of California, Irvine to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo in Tokyo, Japan. The project title is "An Algorithm for Neuron Characterization In Vivo." The host scientist is Dr. Yuji Ikegaya, Associate Professor, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.<br/><br/>While many techniques exist to study the functional organization of neurons, few can use extracellular action potentials (EAPs) to extract crucial neuron parameters such as the location, size, dendritic tree shape, and type of neurons being studied. This study develops a novel framework to monitor neural activity via both extracellular recording and functional multi-neuron calcium imaging (fMCI). Extracellular recording uses micro-sensors placed in neural tissue to detect action potentials from nearby neurons, whereas calcium imaging detects the flow of calcium ions into a cell, causing the cell to effectively light up during an action potential. Extracellular recordings from rat brain slices are analyzed using a new statistical signal processing algorithm to extract the location, size, and type of multiple neurons, while fMCI data provides confirmation of the results. Because extracellular recording is one of the only ways to study neural activity in live animals (in vivo) where direct imaging cannot be performed, the algorithm being tested here can ultimately improve studies of neuronal migration, plasticity, and brain computer interfacing. These kinds of studies can then lead to a better understanding of brain development, healing, and diseases such as dementia. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Furthermore, once tested, the analysis algorithm developed in this study will be freely disseminated as a software package to the neuroscience community at large. This will vastly improve in vivo studies of neural functionality, and therefore have long lasting impact on the scientific community. Neuron activity movies made during the study will also be presented in an outreach program to teach local elementary and high school students about neural network dynamics in an engaging way.

The project title is "Beetles in Flight: Using RNA Sequencing to Analyze Stag Beetle Wing Development." The host scientist is Dr. Shigeo Hayashi.<br/><br/>This research project aims to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the formation of the evolutionarily integral wing structures (elytra) in the coleopteran insects (beetles). The elytra of beetles have been a driving force in the impressive evolutionary success of these insects by providing a protective armoring over the dorsal surface. This project provides the first detailed documentation of these wing structures in a Japanese stag beetle, Dorcus hopei. RNA sequencing techniques along with gene knockdown are also implemented to elucidate the molecular basis of the elytron evolution in these beetles.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the stag beetle is an immensely popular animal in Japanese culture. Often, young adults and children raise the beetles as pets. By initiating the scientific study of such an organism, this project will simultaneously catalyze an interest in science itself among youthful collectors. The CDB in Japan, where this research will be performed, provides open house sessions to the public. Upon completion of the project, findings will be presented during these events as an opportunity for excited stag beetle enthusiasts to learn about project outcomes. Miami University in Ohio also has close connections with the Talawanda School District in the same city. In order to have a more global impact, experiences during this project will be presented to Talawanda school science classes upon completion of the work. By sharing experiences in Japanese culture and science, this project provides an example to students of the international engagement that scientific study can offer. The project also aims to spur an interest in insects and their role in studying evolution and hopes to thereby spawn a scientific fascination among students.

The project title is "Characterizing Environmental Effects on the Physical Properties of Collagen." The host scientist is Professor Toru Asahi.<br/><br/>Many tissues in the body such as ligament, bone, and cornea, derive much of their structural and mechanical properties from type I collagen. All of these tissues have drastically different physical properties but they are all constructed using the same collagen molecule. How the same molecule can be responsible for such a range of tissues is of great importance in the fields of tissue engineering, bio-technology, and more. Previous research has demonstrated that ionic environment plays a key role in the physical properties of individual collagen molecules. For collagen to form a tissue, such as cornea, it has to be assembled in a specific pattern to create a sheet. It remains unknown how the physical properties of individual molecules affect a larger scale collagen sheet. This project investigates the physical properties of collagen sheets and relates them to previous research on collagen molecules. Comparing the physical properties of collagen on these different scales will provide valuable knowledge for engineering collagen based tissues in the future.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Ian Rowen of the University of Colorado, Boulder to conduct a research project in the Social, Behavioral and Economic sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Fudan University in Shanghai, China. The project title is "Tourism and State Territory in 'Greater China.'" The host scientist is Yingzhi Guo.<br/><br/>How is tourism reconfiguring "Greater China," and in particular, relations between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan? Over 1 million Chinese tourists visited Taiwan in 2011, even though the PRC continues to point over 1000 ballistic missiles at what it considers a breakaway province. This marks a profound regional change, with direct tour arrivals from China only permitted to arrive in Taiwan starting in 2008 after decades of tension and travel bans. This ethnographic research project uses tourism as a lens to analyze spatial politics between the PRC and Taiwan, and to explore the relationship between tourism and state territoriality in general. Examining tourism in Taiwan sheds light on the political and cultural implications of the rapid development of China's outbound tourist market, soon to be the world's largest, with over 100 million annual visits overseas projected by 2019. Additionally, this project's theoretical framework brings tourism practice into larger discussions about state power and spatial practice. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Kristen Nolting of Michigan State University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at the University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand. The project title is "Exploring the Past to Understand the Present: Investigating the Historical Radiation and Current Distribution of a Widespread New Zealand Plant Genus, Pittosporum (Pittosporaceae)." The host scientist is Dr. Chrissen Gemmill.<br/><br/>Identifying and quantifying the processes that underlie species distributions remains an important challenge for biologists today. Although it is generally understood that species distributions are the result of ecological interactions operating over evolutionary time scales, most studies to date have failed to fully address how the evolution of these interactions acts to govern changes in species distributions across space and time. This study outlines a conceptual and analytical framework that describes how we can use ecologically informative functional traits in conjunction with phylogenetic and spatial modeling techniques to evaluate how the relationship between ecological and evolutionary processes acts to govern species distributions. Specifically, the study evaluates the evolution of the diverse, widespread New Zealand plant genus, Pittosporum (Pittosporaceae), along various climatic and functional trait axes. This integrative analysis will allow for a better understanding of how the genus evolved as it radiated throughout New Zealand, and how this evolution along ecological axes acts to structure present day species distributions and allows for species co-existence.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the research statement on species distributions described above is pertinent to the question of how biodiversity may respond to anthropogenic pressures. Communicating the outcomes of the Fellow's research to policy makers and the general community can help protect this biodiversity. The Fellow plans to work with other members of the Graduate Women in Science organization at Michigan State University to develop a website that provides access to interactive lesson plans for K-12 classrooms related to biodiversity and its global importance. This website will be shared with teachers in the local school districts with whom the organization already works and/or will be presented by the Fellow and other graduate students in the classrooms themselves.

Abstract: This action funds Jeffrey S. Pigott of The Ohio State University to conduct a research project in Geosciences during the summer of 2013 at Curtin University in Perth, WA, Australia. The project title is "Calculation of the Water Storage Capacity of Garnets in the Earth's Deep Interior." The host scientists are Professor Kate Wright and Professor Julian Gale.<br/><br/>This study addresses the Earth's water budget by calculating the water storage capacity of garnet, a mineral found in the Earth's upper mantle (~60 km - 410 km depth) and transition zone (410 km - 660 km depth). Garnet accounts for as much as 40 percent of the rock volume at 500 km. The water storage capacity of garnet depends on the mechanism by which the crystal structure incorporates hydrogen and is also a function of pressure, temperature, and garnet composition. At low pressures, hydrogen can substitute for silicon in the garnet structure and has been termed the hydrogarnet substitution. It is likely that the hydrogarnet substitution becomes less energetically favored when compared to other mechanisms at greater depths due to pressure. This study calculates the energetics of different defect mechanisms to pressures equivalent to 660-km depth for garnets in the pyrope-almandine system. The disseminated results of this work will compliment experimental studies and can be used by geodynamicists, geochemists, mineral physicists, and seismologists that model and predict the state and evolution of the Earth's mantle. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Jerry Chen of San Diego State University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. The project title is "What Makes a Neuron: Genetic Analysis of Essential Nervous System Genes in a Primitive Marine Invertebrate." The host scientist is Jr-Kai Yu in the Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology.<br/><br/>With Dr. Yu, the Fellow is using the marine invertebrate amphioxus to study the conservation, expression and interaction of the proneural transcription factors Pou4, NeuroD, MyTF and Ash, as well as the proneural microRNAs miR-9 and miR-124. Collectively, these genes are essential to nervous system development in humans, as several recent studies have shown that expression of these genes can convert human stem cells into functional neurons, and dysfunction of these genes results in various neurological diseases. Using DNA sequence alignment tools along with in situ hybridization, this project is determining the conservation and expression patterns of these genes in developing amphioxus embryos. The Fellow is also performing experiments eliminating the expression of each of these genes to determine how these genes interact with each other. Such experiments cannot be done in humans, which is the motivation for doing this work in amphioxus. And since the nervous system of amphioxus is similar to that of human, such genetic analyses give us insight into the how the human nervous system develops.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Ming Eric Tai of Harvard University to conduct a research project in the Math and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. The project title is "Quantum Simulation of Persistent Current in an Ultracold Atomic Gas." The host scientist is Yu-Ju Lin.<br/><br/>Ultracold atomic systems have proven to be a powerful platform for the study of strongly correlated many-body phenomena, such as superconductivity, superfluidity, and quantum magnetism. This project extends the experimental toolbox of these systems by investigating Raman coupling techniques for implementing artificial magnetic fields in neutral atoms and performing benchmark experiments on persistent current and non-classical rotational inertia. The mastery of these techniques provides a direct avenue for studying non-Abelian gauge fields, the quantum Hall effect, and topological insulators in ultracold atoms. The investigation of methods to create artificial magnetic fields is crucial to extending the field of quantum simulation with ultracold atoms. Advances in this field have the potential to simulate and further the understanding of a whole host of exotic materials, such as high-Tc superconductors and spintronic materials-- materials that are not just of scientific curiosity, but instead have already seen use or have proposed applications in computer storage, medical devices, and green energy.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Katherine A. Mazzio of the University of Washington to conduct a research project in the Math and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Victoria University of Wellington in Wellington, New Zealand. The project title is "Exciton Dissociation in Hybrid Materials for Solar Energy Conversion." The host scientist is Justin Hodgkiss.<br/><br/>One of the most promising renewable resources lies in photovoltaics for electricity generation. For many applications, however, the product output of photovoltaics has been limited by materials scarcity and competition with the microelectronics industry, as well as by a limited ability to control the structure-property relationships of the materials used in photovoltaic devices. Using a recently developed method for the in-situ functionalization of semiconducting nanocrystals with pi-conjugated molecules during growth, the performance of hybrid photovoltaic devices is expected to be significantly enhanced, while allowing them to be solution processed. This project examines the charge transfer dynamics in these new hybrid materials. Specifically, it will investigate how varying the concentration of polythiophene ligands affects both the loading on cadmium selenide quantum dots and the resulting charge transfer rates for use in hybrid photovoltaic devices. This information will result in a better understanding of the charge transfer processes in hybrid materials, while aiding in future design aspects of optoelectronic materials, which will in turn benefit society by resulting in improved materials for photovoltaic devices towards zero-emission electricity generation. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Furthermore, the proposed research will result in the Fellow obtaining a fundamental understanding of the electron transport phenomena inside the active layer of these next-generation solar cells. The Fellow will couple this experimental data with computer modeling of the charge transport processes in order to act as a predictive tool for the rational design of future light-harvesting systems. The results of this project will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences, in addition to informal presentations regarding the EAPSI program and the results obtained over the course of this program within the University of Washington.

Abstract: This action funds Seema Ehsan of the University of California, Irvine to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases in Osaka, Japan. The project title is "Development of a Personalized Anti-Cancer Drug Screening Platform." The host scientist is Professor Masahiro Inoue.<br/><br/>Precise replication of complex biological environments is necessary to more accurately mimic the human response to drugs. The development of anti-cancer compounds has become dependent on either animal models or in vitro systems that use established cells lines, both of which have diminishing relevance to actual patient outcomes. Primary cultures derived directly from patient biopsies may enable the development of more individualized anti-cancer therapies. Combining these cultures with a tissue-engineered model of the tumor microenvironment enables the creation of an experimental platform that is able to manipulate patient-specific "living" solid tumors. Experimental testing with such a platform enhances the efforts of personalized cancer therapy, whereupon the results could be used to individualize treatment for the patient from whom the cells were derived. The system could be used as an anti-cancer drug-screening platform that is faster, more cost-effective, and a better prediction of clinical response compared to current methods. Understanding the causes of cancer, and developing coordinated efforts to prevent and manage the disease, has enormous impact on public health across the country and the world. Exploring models that investigate the mechanisms of cancer biology will allow for the development of more targeted and effective treatment strategies, and may ultimately enhance the quality of care and quality of life of patients. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Sheila Kitchen of Oregon State University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) and Tropical Biosphere Research Center of University of Ryukyus in Okinawa, Japan. The project title is "Impacts of Hyperthermal Stress on Coral Larvae Undergoing Symbiont Colonization." The host scientists are Drs. Nori Satoh and Saki Harii.<br/><br/>Symbiotic corals form mutualistic associations with photosynthetic algae. These associations are threatened by global climate change where the partnerships collapse resulting in the loss of algae from the host, known as coral bleaching. We are beginning to identify the physiological and molecular consequences of bleaching events on host-symbiont associations in adults, but very few studies address the affects of temperature-induced stress during onset and establishment of symbiosis in coral larvae. This study extends work on hyperthermic stress of coral larvae through examination of elevated temperature exposed larvae health and survivorship, symbiont colonization success, and RNA-Seq transcript expression profiles. RNA-Seq analysis is an unbiased, high-throughput approach that surpasses preceding expression profiling technologies (e.g. microarrays or suppressive subtractive hybridization) in its ability to detect rare transcripts with more precision. The outcomes of this study further our understanding of the physical environment and biotic pressures that mediate pre-settlement events in corals and provides novel transcriptional patterns of the molecular coral stress response. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Kevin Yehl of Emory University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at National University of Singapore in Singapore. The project title is "Correcting Gene Errors by Using a Nanoparticle Therapy." The host scientist is Dr. Xiaogang Liu.<br/><br/>Nature's ability to selectively edit the genome by cleaving and ligating portions of messenger RNA (mRNA) is a process termed splicing and enables a single gene to encode for a diverse set of proteins. This processes increases the diversity of living systems and is responsible for why complex organisms, such as humans, can display vast collection of proteins using such a relatively small number of genes. Although this process is highly regulated, it remains error prone, and can result in specific types of diseases. This research project addresses this problem by rationally designing a synthetic spliceosome, a nano-spliceozyme, through spatially confining the appropriate catalytic units on a nanoparticle scaffold, which can edit these problematic gene products (mRNA). If successful, the project may lead to novel therapeutics to treat cancers and undruggable genetic diseases.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

The project title is "The Interaction between Star Formation and Cosmic Reionization." The host scientist is Naoki Yoshida.<br/><br/>In order to study the universe in large scales with limited computation power, one needs to incorporate unresolvably small-scale physics into simulations in approximate ways. The epoch of reionization is an example that requires such techniques as its physics spans a wide dynamic range from the size of star forming clouds of a few parsecs (1 parsec = 3.1 x 10^13 kilometers) to the size of the ionized bubbles of the intergalactic medium of tens of megaparsecs (1 megaparsec = 3.1 x 10^19 kilometers).

Abstract: This action funds Nicholas Craig von Sternberg of the University of Houston to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the Dynamic Systems and Control Laboratory of National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The project title is "Further Optimization of a Robot Inspired by Tai-Chi." The host scientist is Professor Ting-Jen Yeh.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this research lies within the research and development of a power-efficient walking robot. The applied power-saving technique, which was inspired by the ancient martial art of Tai-Chi, involves motion planning to use minimal actuation power to maintain balance at each point in the gait-cycle and disable unnecessary actuators. Further experimental analysis is being performed to determine additional power saving potential from the use of hybrid stepper motors and a custom controller in place of servomotors. This experiment is a result of the collaborative use of theory, hardware, and software developed by two geographically and culturally independent universities. The results of these projects could result in more power-efficient, environment friendly, walking robots with longer operation times; such robots could be used to increase the livelihood of the elderly or disabled, assist in tasks of daily life, or enter a hazardous situation in place of a human being.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Sara Enders of the University of California, Davis to conduct a research project in Geology during the summer of 2013 at The Japan Agency for Marine Earth-Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) in Yokuska, Japan. The project title is "Developing a New Biomarker-Based Proxy for Past Terrestrial Nitrogen Cycles." The host scientist is Dr. Naohiko Ohkouchi.<br/><br/>This project develops a method to reconstruct how nitrogen cycles of pre-industrial landscapes behaved in the past during periods of environmental and ecological change. Changes in past nitrogen cycle behavior--e.g. the availability of nitrogen to plants, and whether nitrogen losses from the ecosystem have a dominant atmospheric or hydrologic fate--may be inferable from information contained in the isotope ratios (delta-N-15) of nitrogenous plant compounds that persist in soil. The project investigates the potential to reconstruct delta-N-15 of leaves on past landscapes from the delta-N-15 of chlorophyll degradation products extractable from soil. This research evaluates 1) the persistence of the target plant compounds in soil--duration and mechanisms; and 2) the quality of information obtainable--whether isotope ratios are conserved as plants tissues degrade to soil organic matter. This method could remove significant limitations (e.g. diagenetic vulnerability, confounding trophic effects, and availability of fossil material) to a paleoreconstruction approach to testing major working hypotheses about how N and C biogeochemical cycles interact over decade to millennial timescales. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

The project title is "Synthetic Modifications to the Cyclic Protein Kalata B1." The host scientist is Dr. David Craik.<br/><br/>Cyclic peptides (cyclotides) are small proteins with a continuous circular backbone, forming a structure that is resistant to thermal and enzymatic degradation. Kalata B1 is a plant-derived cyclotide woven with three disulfide bonds, creating an exceptionally stable structure with anti-HIV activity. Due to its short sequence, there are few sites for functionalization in Kalata B1 that do not change its core structural stability. This project broadens the potential applications of Kalata B1 by incorporating non-natural amino acids with bioorthogonal chemical "handles," generating a uniquely versatile and stable platform for molecular scaffolding. These integrated "handles" can be further modified to decorate synthetic Kalata B1 with small molecules, materials, and proteins for applications in materials science and small molecule library screening.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Furthermore, this fellowship will establish an international, interdisciplinary collaboration based on the design, synthesis, and applications of modifiable cyclotides for biomolecular scaffolding. On completion of this work, the results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal so that other researchers may use cyclotide scaffolds in new applications.

The project title is "The Anatomy and Evolutionary Relationships of a Peculiar Dinosaur from Wucaiwan (Xinjiang, People's Republic of China)." The host scientist is Xu Xing.<br/><br/>The theropod dinosaur Limusaurus inextricabilis is a basal ceratosaur of uncertain relationships from the Jurassic Shishugou formation of Xinjiang. Its highly reduced, four-fingered hand has undergone bilateral digital reduction, a condition previously unknown in Mesozoic theropods but known to be present in the three-fingered hands of birds via embryological evidence. This project documents the skeletal anatomy of Limusaurus, in order to resolve its relationships within Ceratosauria. Should it occupy a basal position within the clade, it may provide evidence for a frameshift in digit identity in the most recent common ancestor of Limusaurus and more derived theropods (including birds), or that ancestor's stem lineage.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Furthermore, the evolution of dinosaurs is a topic of great interest to the public and is often introduced to children at a young age. Given the potential for this project to resolve a conflict between paleontological and embryological evidence regarding the evolution of the hand along the lineage leading to modern birds, it may provide further opportunities to engage the public with science and an accessible example of evolutionary-developmental biology (evo-devo) for science education.

Preliminary results showed one such measure which improved play of a computer Go engine that used Monte Carlo search, and this project develops further measures along with discovering their effectiveness and limitations. By studying these modifications which touch the very nature of Monte Carlo search, this project explores the applicability and limitations of Monte Carlo search in general and whether or not hybrid methods offer an opportunity for their improvement. This research will be directly applicable to other problems using the Monte Carlo search method such as military simulation software, along with some large online simulation software systems.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

The project title is "Exploring How the Interaction of Warm and Cold Gas Regulates Star Formation." The host scientist is Satoki Matsushita.<br/><br/>A central question in galaxy evolution is how star formation is regulated during times of vigorous star formation. Recent theories suggest that supernovae heat gas to high temperatures, and this hot gas interacts with nearby cold gas to suppress star formation. This interaction heats and moves the cold gas in a galactic outflow, which produces many fundamental galaxy relations (the mass-metallicity relation, the cosmic star formation history, the multi-phase interstellar medium, etc.). This project compares the physical conditions (the temperature and density) of carbon monoxide (measured from Sub-Millimeter Array data, reduced and analyzed over the summer) with previous spatial maps of the warm ionized gas to investigate if the two different types of gas relate to each other.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Alyssa Ann Pearson of University of Wyoming to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Victoria University of Wellington in Wellington, New Zealand. The project title is "Solar Conversion of Water to Fuels Using Photoactive Metals." The host scientists are Dr. John Spencer and Dr. Justin Hodgkiss.<br/><br/>An ideal water-splitting system would involve a cell in which one metal catalyst performs water splitting to produce oxygen, hydron (H+), and electrons. The protons (H+) and electrons (e-) would move through a membrane to a second cell in which the formation of hydrogen gas occurs via a second metal catalyst. The hydrogen is then collected and can be used in a fuel cell or as a combustion fuel while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere and is hence completely green and renewable. This research incorporates a unique and important area of chemistry, metal Arduengo-type carbene coordination. The approach is novel because it incorporates a dual metal system that is coordinated to a fused phenanthroline-imidazole ring system, with one metal coordinating to the carbene moiety on the imidazole, while the other is integrated into the organic scaffold on the N,N'-phenanthroline position. This enables hydrogen molecule formation, by using one metal to perform the oxidation of water while the other metal performs reduction thereby splitting water and producing a fuel. These new di-metallic complexes have shown to exhibit light-sensitivity and will be used as potential water oxidation and reduction catalysts.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Future graduate students from the University of Wyoming will be encouraged to apply to the EASPI fellowship and be made more aware of opportunities for international travel and research.

Abstract: This action funds Sven Nelson of Washington State University to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the RIKEN Plant Science Center in Yokohama, Japan. The project title is "Investigating the Roles of Two Plant Hormones, Gibberellin and Abscisic Acid, in Arabidopsis Seed Dormancy." The host scientist is Dr. Mitsunori Seo.<br/><br/>The balance between seed dormancy and germination is governed by two plant hormones, abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA). Dormancy is a period during which seeds will not germinate, even under favorable conditions. Dormancy is released by dry storage called after-ripening. During dry after-ripening levels of ABA fall. GA levels rise when after-ripened seeds imbibe water, but it is unclear whether GA levels rise during after-ripening of dry seeds. One reason for this is that the low hormone levels in dry seeds are difficult to measure. Use of new highly sensitive techniques employed at the RIKEN institute enables us to investigate the roles of ABA and GA in seed dormancy release and germination. This research will benefit society because knowledge of the hormonal control of seed dormancy will allow better control of germination in cereal crops to prevent problems such as preharvest sprouting and poor seedling emergence. Knowledge of seed germination will also allow the development of crops with good germination and seedling emergence, a major determinant of yield. It will advance discovery in the area of seed biology while advancing learning through teaching the Fellow new technologies for hormone analysis.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Furthermore, the results of this research will be broadly disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal together with Dr. Seo, and through oral presentations to other scientists. In addition, a presentation about this research topic will be made to the Washington State University Future Cougars of Color to encourage high school students from underrepresented groups to pursue education or a career in science.

Abstract: This action funds David Fryxell of the University of California Santa Cruz to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at the University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand. The project title is "Invasive Species in a Changing Climate: How Will Contemporary Trait Change Shape the Dynamics of Invaded Ecosystems?" The host scientist is Dr. Kevin Simon.<br/><br/>As global temperatures rise freshwater organisms must adapt, and recent evidence suggests that rapid evolutionary adaptation can affect ecosystems in contemporary time. In order to understand the potential effects of contemporary thermal adaptation on freshwater ecosystems, this project focuses on understanding how an invasive fish, the western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), has adapted to warm geothermal ponds, and how that thermal adaptation affects freshwater communities and ecosystems processes. This project is the first to explicitly test the ecological implications of contemporary thermal adaptation. It also addresses key issues facing New Zealand's environment (global warming and invasive species), and contributes novel insight to the nascent field of eco-evo dynamics (where evolution and ecology are interacting in contemporary time). <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Rachel Racicot of Yale University to conduct a research project in Geosciences during the summer of 2013 at The National Museum of Nature and Science/Tsukuba Science Center in Tokyo and Tsukuba, Japan. The project title is "Evolution of Echolocation in Porpoises and Dolphins Elucidated from High-Resolution CT Scans Revealing Inner Ear Morphology." The host scientist is Dr. Naoki Kohno.<br/><br/>Living dolphins and whales (cetaceans) employ echolocation as a means of avoiding predators and finding prey; this involves a unique suite of anatomical features that allows the emission and reception of sound from parts of the ear, skull, and soft tissue structures. How porpoises and their relatives evolved echolocation is an important area of research crucial to developing more effective conservation strategies. In particular, the inner ears of these animals perform a pivotal role in both sense of space and sound reception. This project examines the evolution of echolocation in porpoises and their relatives by digitally extracting the inner ear labyrinths from computed tomographic (CT) scans of some of the earliest fossil delphinoids, and comparing them with extant species. Documenting the changing morphology of inner ears from early-diverging porpoises to extant species provides a sense for how they perceive the three-dimensional world around them. This project CT scans Fossils and recent material from museum collections in Japan and the morphology of their inner ears is digitally reconstructed using state-of-the-art software. The morphology of inner ears helps reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between modern groups of dolphins and porpoises, for which additional morphological evidence is sorely needed. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the analyses used by the Fellow employ cutting-edge CT scans and software for accurate measurement and statistical analyses. These CT data represent an increasingly important resource in the earth and natural sciences; three-dimensional analyses allow for non-destructive digital examination of internal features (which are otherwise impossible to obtain), and are permanent digital records available to future researchers, museums, and the general public via websites such as www.digimorph.org. This project will be submitted to peer-reviewed scientific journals such as the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, and Paleontological Research. The charismatic nature of marine mammals affords exceptional opportunities for public outreach, including lectures and development of educational materials. Ongoing mentorship of undergraduates at Yale in the use and interpretation of CT scans will be enhanced by this research in Japan. The Fellow will also share her experiences with the Japanese Society for Women in Science.

Abstract: This action funds Nicholas Alunni of Worcester Polytechnic Institute to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon, South Korea. The project title is "Creating an Interactive User Interface for a Humanoid Robot used in Disaster Response." The host scientist is Jun Ho Oh.<br/><br/>This project works to create a highly dynamic user interface that can be used on any robot, for any task, with minimal training required. Creating a fully immersive user interface is an important aspect of this. The majority of current user interfaces focus on portraying information through sight alone, negating 80% of the human senses. To successfully supervise any robot, maps need to be created to intuitively display information from the robot to more senses in its human counterpart, such as touch and audio. This project helps make robot supervision, not teleoperation, the new paradigm for human-robot interaction. This project uses the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge (DRC) as a prototype application for the user interface. Their challenge is to create a humanoid robot capable of interacting with our world, not an idealistic one, in order to respond to a simulated nuclear power plant disaster. This challenge poses an incredibly hard problem to solve given the high complexity of a humanoid robot and current technological capabilities. This fellowship provides unlimited access to the HUBO humanoid robot in Korea that will be used for the challenge.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this work will be released as open source software once it is completed, which will benefit the entire robotics community. The EAPSI experience and work will also be presented at the home institute, which will foster future international collaboration.

The host scientist is Dr. Kazuhiro Sakai.<br/><br/>This project seeks to elucidate the effect that the maternal thermal environment of a scleractinian coral has on modulating the response of early life stages to thermal stress. Maternal effects on the phenotype of offspring will be induced by incubating maternal coral colonies at ambient and high temperatures that reflect ecologically relevant thermal shifts projected under climate change scenarios. The physiological response of offspring spawned from these colonies will be evaluated under thermal stress to assess the potential of maternal effects as a beneficial mechanism for offspring faced with environmental stressors. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. This present study will contribute to a body of research that works to characterize the impact that climate change will have on coral reefs. Such research is essential for the implementation of informed management strategies that attempt to preserve these ecosystems that have high economical value to the countries that they surround through the provision of coastal protection, fisheries, and ecotourism. This project contains broad applications significant to climate change research, thermal biology, population ecology and maternal effects studies. Personal emphasis is placed on the importance of utilizing research opportunities, such as those provided through EAPSI, to promote scientific knowledge through outreach and educational settings in order to make primary research more accessible to the general public. Previous research conducted in Taiwan will be integrated with this project in Japan as part of a larger framework that seeks to build collaborations between researchers in USA, Taiwan, Japan, and Hong Kong. These collaborations aim to construct an integrated knowledge base that will elucidate the impact that climate change will have on coral reefs on a global scale.

Abstract: This action funds Maxwell Christopher Wilson of Arizona State University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at Beijing Normal University in Beijing, China. The project title is "Gauging the Impacts of China's South-to-North Water Transfer Project." The host scientist is Dr. Li Xiaoyan.<br/><br/>The North China Plain (NCP), home to more than 25% of China's population and served by three rivers (Hai, Huang, and Huai), faces per capita water scarcity as acute as any region of the world. Exacerbated by the NCP?s critical place in China's food supply, this scarcity has long lead the Chinese government to seek alternative measures for alleviating water stress. First conceived in the 1950s by Chairman Mao, the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP) represents the grandest attempt to permanently solve the NCP's water woes. Started in 2002, after a 50 year feasibility study, currently one of three planned routes is completed, delivering 9 billion cubic meters per year of water to the NCP. However, while construction is ongoing, the impacts of the SNWTP on ecosystems are unknown. This project aims to close two main knowledge gaps, taking lessons from similar water transfer projects in Arizona and applying them to the SNWTP. Specifically this research quantifies both water lost to evaporation and the impact of habitat fragmentation along the canal route. To assure that the data are actionable, this project focuses on the middle route of the SNWTP which is currently under construction. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

The project title is "Increasing Bandwidth Efficiency in Distributed Sensing Using Limited-Feedback Strategies." The host scientist is Prof. Abbas Jamalipour.<br/><br/>One of the main limitations of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is their stringent energy and bandwidth constraints. This project reduces the amount of required feedback information communicated from the central entity of a WSN, called the fusion center (FC), to distributed sensors, using an adapted form of limited-feedback strategies. In particular, the Fellow and host are designing channel-aware, adaptive power-allocation schemes for linear distributed estimation in WSNs based on limited feedback of forward channel state information (CSI) from the FC to local sensors. Different codebook-design approaches for the quantization of the CSI vector space are being investigated and the effects of this quantization on the estimation performance of various linear distributed estimators are being studied, measured by the minimum mean-squared error, estimation outage probability, and estimation diversity.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society and culture.

Abstract: This action funds Howard Chiou of Emory University to conduct a research project in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. The project title is "Investigating How Cultures of Western Biomedicine are Changing from a Focus on Individuals to Teams in Australia." The host scientist is Dr. Lenore Manderson.<br/><br/>Western biomedicine is rapidly changing--shifting from older models that emphasize the autonomy of individual caregivers towards interdisciplinary teams. This project constructs a comparative ethnography of physicians and nurses working within a team-based care model implemented in both Australia and the United States. Through grounded analyses of ethnographic participant observation and in-depth interviews, the effects of this new emphasis on local hierarchies, nurse-physician relationships, and medical authority can begin to be determined. This data connects small group dynamics on a hospital unit with the greater institutions of the hospital and biomedicine, furthering our knowledge of biomedicine as both bureaucracy and institution. This knowledge will help expand theory on the sociological structure of biomedicine, and ultimately inform the anthropology of biomedicine as a complex and international human phenomenon. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Furthermore, this project will form an important component of a doctoral thesis that will be disseminated to a variety of audiences, including both anthropologists and policymakers, through publication or presentation at academic conferences. The Fellow will also organize a half-day symposium on the anthropology of hospitals as institutions, facilitating both local and international collaborations on the topic, and also participate in teleconferences at both Monash University and University of Warwick (UK) with students and researchers from multiple disciplines. Finally, the project plan includes focus groups to discuss initial findings with research informants, increasing engagement with local non-academic communities.

Abstract: This action funds Spyridon Pavlidis of the Georgia Institute of Technology to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the National Chiao Tung University in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The project title is "Stability Enhancement of Roll-to-Roll Printed InGaZnO Thin Film Transistors on Flexible Plastic Substrates." The host scientist is Prof. Bing-Yue Tsui.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this work is to enhance the stability of indium gallium zinc oxide (InGaZnO) thin film transistors (TFTs) on flexible, low-cost plastic substrates using roll-to-roll manufacturing techniques so that they can be deployed in TFT-based biochemical sensor arrays. Electrical stability is of particular importance in a field-effect transistor (FET) chemical sensor since intrinsic drift of the reference drain current can lead to false positives as well as compromised limits of detection. In addition to optimizing the fabrication steps, through the use of advanced bias techniques, such as bipolar pulsed biasing, the mechanisms of bias stress and recovery are being explored in detail, giving rise to a firmer grasp of the device physics at play. This, in turn, helps suggest which bias schemes are suitable for deployment of such devices as chemical sensors. Moreover, the issues of single device performance, wide-area reproducibility and system integration are all being considered on a large scale as a function of these advanced printing methods. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, to address the need for a highly-skilled workforce in the U.S., the Fellow intends to study how primary, secondary and higher educational institutions in Taiwan have contributed to shaping the public's perception of engineering and have permitted the country to become an international leader in the semiconductor and foundry industries. Lastly, with the imminent introduction of InGaZnO TFT-based flexible displays to the market in mind, the simultaneous development of biochemical sensors using the same technology as a result of this EAPSI fellowship could lead to an exciting marriage that profoundly changes the ways that humans interact with portable devices, such as watches and mobile phones; thus giving way to the formation of new enterprises and economic stimulation in the future.

Abstract: This action funds Stephanie C. Bolyard of University of Central Florida (UCF) to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Tongji University in Shanghai, China. The project title is "Evaluation of Proactive Treatment Processes to Reduce the Long-Term Pollution Potential of Landfills." The host scientist is Dr. Pinjing He.<br/><br/>This project investigated the Pump and Treat Aerobic Flushing Bioreactor Landfill (PTAFBL) as a novel approach to sustainable solid waste management. This completion phase is a method of immediate pollution removal of releasable carbon and ammonia-nitrogen as opposed to the traditional method of entombment. The goal of this innovative approach was to reduce the long-term risk of landfills by eliminating significant sources of pollution. Outcomes of this project advance the current understanding of how and when functional stability of a landfill is met through the characterization of solid waste residuals and leachate at the molecular level over time.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture, and language. These activities meet the NSF goal of promoting international collaboration early in the career of scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Additionally, as the PI disseminates the results of this research and the technology is adopted by the waste industry, society will benefit from the reduced long-term adverse impacts of landfills on human health the environment. Undergraduate students working in the host researcher's laboratory were involved in this research and upon return to the U.S. the PI will discuss her experiences with undergraduate engineering students at UCF. Results from this research will also be shared through participation in ICubed, a NSF funded project, which is aimed at informing the UCF community and public about engineering and science concepts. The PI will specifically participate in the Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) activity which encourages STEM researchers and visual art and design students to create STEM inspired artifacts (sculptures, paintings, illustrations, and posters). The PI's contributions to this activity helps promote a greater appreciation and understanding of STEM fields and their importance in society.

Abstract: This action funds Gengen Friday He of The University of Tennessee to conduct a research project in the Social, Behavioral and Economic sciences area, during the summer of 2013 at The University of Tokyo in Kashiwa, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. The project title is "Investigating Collaborative Simultaneous Wayfinding in a Culturally Unfamiliar Setting." The host scientist is Dr. Toru Ishikawa.<br/><br/>In an increasingly more culturally diverse and spatially complex world, little is known about a city's cultural-specific-landscape effect on the way people navigate, or what types of spatial information are communicated during navigation. This project is investigating how foreigners and local residents acquire, interpret, process and communicate spatial information during active simultaneous collaborative wayfinding in a Japanese City. This is a novel experimental setup that combines cognitive behavioral spatial science with geographic information science to understand the interaction between people, environment and technology. This study re-examines and synthesizes theories in cognitive psychology, the spatial information acquisition process, landmark recognition, active navigation, and communication. Furthermore, this study can make a practical contribution to designing better navigation aids for foreigners in Japan and help to create more navigation friendly cities for immigrants and visitors in America. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds Alison Marie Tseng of the University of Pittsburgh to conduct a research project in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at National Taiwan Normal University in Taipei. The project title is "The Effect of Being Immersed in a First or Second Language Environment on Bilingual Translation." The host scientist is Dr. Jun Ren Lee.<br/><br/>Previous research has demonstrated that translation ambiguity, the availability of multiple translations, is relatively common and affects adult second language learning and adult bilingual processing. Previous research on translation ambiguity has primarily focused on European languages. However, the United States Census 2010 showed that, between 2000 and 2010, the Asian population increased more than other populations. Further, within the Asian population, the largest population was the Chinese population. Given this, it is imperative to include non-European languages in general, and Mandarin in particular, in the research on translation ambiguity. This project collects English-Mandarin translation norms in Taiwan, allowing a direct comparison between translation norms collected in the United States and in Taiwan. This research answers the questions of: (1) whether translation ambiguity is relatively common between English and Mandarin; (2) whether the correlations between translation ambiguity and word-level characteristics such as concreteness and frequency hold when the two languages do not share an orthography; and (3) how language environment affects the translations that are provided. Further, this research examines the types of errors that are made across a range of proficiencies, allowing for a characterization of the types of errors that bilinguals make in the progression from novice to expert.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the results of the proposed research could be used to understand how bilinguals resolve translation ambiguity in their day-to-day communication, and how to reduce errors caused by translation ambiguity. Bilinguals must resolve this ambiguity regularly in their day-to-day communication to avoid errors in communication.

Abstract: This action funds Daniel Brenner of the University of Arizona to conduct a research project in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. The project title is "Mandarin Tone Perception in Conversational and Read Speech." The host scientist is Dr. HU Fang.<br/><br/>In Mandarin, words are distinguished not only by segments ([ba] 'to pull out' vs. [pa] 'to climb'), but also by tone, the pattern of vocal pitch overlaid on the syllable ([pa] with rising pitch, 'to climb'; [pa] with falling pitch, 'to fear'). This project describes the relationship between tones as produced in conversation to those in careful speech, and how those differences affect listeners' perception of tones in the two speech styles. In the first phase of the project, recordings are made of Mandarin speakers in conversation and reading a list of words, and the acoustics of the two kinds of tone productions will be compared. In a second phase, Mandarin-speaking subjects perform a perception task on those words, either with full acoustic information, or with a filtered version that removes segmental detail from the recordings. In this way, a measurement of the contributions of tone and segmental information to the identification of words can be made. Further understanding of tone and conversational speech enable developments in second language Mandarin pedagogy, where a great deal of emphasis is placed on learning to produce and detect tones, an endeavor that does not come easily to many American students. The details of tonal realizations are also vital for progress in human language technologies such as automatic speech recognition, where the ultimate goal is to program computers to understand naturally produced speech, as in conversation.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, publication of the results following completion of the study will disseminate the findings widely to linguists and researchers in related fields.

The project title is "The Effect of Organic Matter on the Fate of Disinfection By-Products during the Production of High Quality Recycled Water." The host scientist is Dr. Maria Jos Farr.<br/><br/>Water scarcity and compromised source water quality is a major issue facing many areas of the US and around the world; the need for alternative water sources continues to grow. Membranes can be used to address this problem; specifically to treat wastewater or compromised water sources in conjunction with other treatment processes to produce high quality potable water. Disinfection by-products (DBPs), which are potentially harmful to human health, are formed during water disinfection. How they can be prevented from ending up in finished water during high quality recycled water production is important for the protection of public health. This study specifically investigates the role organic matter plays on the fate of DBPs in membrane treatment. This project will add to the fundamental understanding and practical issues of membrane treatment, disinfection-by product fate, water recycling, and the implementation of this new technology. The production of high quality water from wastewater can be a major sustainable alternative source for drinking water, and the inevitable move toward potable water reuse makes the thorough investigation of water recycling even more vital at this time.<br/><br/> Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

The host scientist is Professor YANG Jian.<br/><br/>Boreal forests comprise 32% of the world's forests and they are an important global carbon sink and provider of timber and forest products. Milder winters and drought stress in trees from climate change may facilitate insect pest outbreaks that lead to high rates of tree mortality. The role of temperatures in insect outbreaks is relatively unknown in the northeastern forests of China, and a remote sensing system to monitor and predict outbreaks there is largely undeveloped. This study is exploring the relationship between temperature, insect abundance, and tree health to validate a regional pest monitoring program for long-term forest management and conservation. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.

Abstract: This action funds David Fuhry of The Ohio State University to conduct a research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at Singapore Management University's Living Analytics Research Center in Singapore. The project title is "Finding and Characterizing Communities in Online Social Networks: Utilizing Content, Links, Interactions and Affinities." The host scientist is Ee-Peng Lim.<br/><br/>Important functions and discoveries in the social and computational sciences relate to the understanding of information networks. A fundamental task in gaining high-level knowledge from these networks is to find communities within which nodes are strongly related but between which nodes are only weakly related. In social networks these communities are found and characterized using available content, location, time and relationship information. This project addresses two sets of questions: 1) Social Media Analysis: Given large, dynamic, noisy networks, how can communities be identified and characterized, and the predictive power of discovered communities, i.e. to what extent does the behavior of a community determine or correspond with the individual behavior of its constituent users? And 2) Systems Challenges: To what extent can emerging high-performance computer architectures be utilized (e.g. using many standard processors or graphics processors in parallel within a computer, and using many networked computers in parallel) and scalable data analysis techniques (e.g. new high-performance data processing systems under active development by internet technology companies and the research community) to achieve fast, approximate results and user-driven interactive discovery on social media data? This research builds on promising initial results for fast approximate query response by transforming data according to a computational technique known as "locality-sensitive hashing," and for distinguishing community differences by a visual-analytic method of plotting communities' cumulative term (word) frequencies across local and global axes.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the results - data, tools, and algorithms - are being disseminated through the publication of one or more research papers in internationally recognized social-computing research conferences, and as freely available software posted on the Fellow's web page for others to use and build on. This dissemination is consistent with the Fellow's strong track record of research paper and software publication. The Fellow's EAPSI experience will be featured in a dedicated column of The Ohio State University Department of Computer Science and Engineering department's Fall newsletter, with a circulation in the thousands of students, staff, and alumni. Outside of academia, immediately subsequent to the EAPSI fellowship the Fellow has a Fall internship at a leading U.S. social network company, Twitter, Inc. (San Francisco, CA), during which the EAPSI research results will be disseminated and to the extent possible, used to improve Twitter's capabilities.

Abstract: This action funds David Hamilton Case of the California Institute of Technology to conduct a research project in Geosciences during the summer of 2013 at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) in Kochi, Japan. The project title is "Understanding Which Microbial Species Live Below the Seafloor and What They Eat." The host scientist is Dr. Fumio Inagaki.<br/><br/>Marine mud volcanoes are hydrocarbon-rich areas where sediment is moved upward from deep within Earth's oceanic crust to the seafloor. Samples taken from the top of a marine mud volcano (i.e., the seafloor) are often assumed to be representative of geochemical and biological conditions deep within the oceanic crust (i.e., 100s of meters below the seafloor). This study directly tests this assumption by recovering biological samples from the top of a marine mud volcano and 115 meters below the ocean floor. Starting in 2012 biological samples were incubated with stable isotope-labeled food sources (e.g. 13C-methane, 13C-glucose, 15N-ammonium) for one year. Following incubation and with the assistance of EAPSI 2013 support microbiological cells are (1) identified by phylogeny and (2) analyzed for isotopic content to determine which cells consumed which food sources. This informs the identity and metabolic function of microbial communities in Earth's subsurface and tests the assumption that the top and bottom of marine mud volcanoes contain identical conditions.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, society will benefit by increased knowledge of the microbial controls on geochemistry in a hydrocarbon-rich environment which has been proposed as a potential untapped source of natural gas. Additionally, the Fellow is involved in teaching K-12 science through activities, lessons, and talks. Sharing stories, photographs, and excitement for science with a young audience promotes teaching, training, learning, and inspiration of future generations of scientists.

Abstract: This action funds Charles Yeager of graduate Penn State University to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Tokyo Institute of Technology. The project title is "Increasing Power from Thin Film Vibration Harvesters to Power Autonomous Sensor Networks." The host scientist is Professor Hiroshi Funakubo.<br/><br/>Piezoelectric energy harvesting systems can convert ambient mechanical vibrations into a source for electric energy to power microelectromechanical sensors and there is a drive to increase the harvested power level to allow more sophisticated sensor systems, or enable the duty cycle for data transmission to be increased. The Fellow recently made an experimental characterization of piezoelectric lead zirconium titanate (PZT) thin films to be used in vibration energy harvesting systems and demonstrated that increasing the c-axis texture in the film allowed the energy generation figure of merit to increase. This work has raised questions as to the magnitude of the energy generation properties of PZT films with 100% c-axis texture. This project grows PZT films by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition at several compositions and with systematically changing c-axis texture to find how the single-domain energy generation factor changes as a function of composition, as well as reporting the highest possible property for this application. The c-axis texture is controlled by selecting substrates with appropriate thermal expansion coefficient and through growth temperature. These are primary factors to control thermal stress. It is predicted that a 100% c-axis PZT 30/70 film would have twice the figure of merit as the best reported PZT grown by sol-gel. Also, fundamental knowledge is gained by the direct measurement of how the transverse piezoelectric coefficient changes with c-axis texture for {001}PZT films. The c-axis texture is characterized by 4-circle X-ray diffraction and by infrared spectroscopy as well. The piezoelectric coefficient is characterized by the wafer flexure method.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the experience and results of the research will be presented at the Fellow's home institution to groups of various backgrounds.

Abstract: This action funds Hiroto Kameyama of University of California, San Diego to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at Ehime University in Ehime, Japan. The project title is "(Re)investigation of Wolbachia Infections in Wild Japanese Populations of Drosophila bifasciata." The host scientist is Dr. Masayoshi Watada.<br/><br/>In 1969, Dr. Hiroshi Ikeda investigated the occurrence of "sex-ratio" females in wild populations of Drosophila bifasciata in Japan. "Sex-ratio" or SR females have been shown to kill XY zygotes in early developmental stages, producing a strong bias toward female offspring. Later investigations showed that the Wolbachia-infected D. bifasciata induce male deaths during embryonic development, and further analyses illustrated some of the fundamental mechanisms of selective male killings. The project re-investigates the frequency of "sex-ratio" females in three islands of Japan (Hokkaido, Honshu, and Shikoku) almost half a century after the initial survey and tests for an association with Wolbachia infection in any SR females. <br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the project in Japan gives American scientists access to researchers and resources in Japan; building bridges between American institutions and Japanese researchers. In addition, the samples of various Drosophila species collected from the three islands will be made available to the international scientific community through Ehime Fly. Finally, it assesses the relationship between what is discovered with a model organism such as Drosophila, and a widespread endosymbiotic bacteria, Wolbachia, under laboratory conditions with what occurs in the wild, and in doing so, bear on the ability to generalize from the laboratory to the natural world.

The project title is "Comparing Coral Diseases and Parasites at Sites with Anthropogenic Stress at Sanya, Hainan Island." The host scientist is Dr. Kefu Yu.<br/><br/>This project characterizes and compares coral diseases and parasites in China at three reef sites (Luhuitou, Xiaodonghai and Dadonghai fringing reefs) at Sanya, Hainan Island. This project identifies coral diseases and parasites in China through coral health surveys, analysis of carbon requirements of the microbes in coral mucus, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and histological examination. This is the first comprehensive study to characterize and identify the coral diseases of Sanya, Hainan Island, China. Currently, there is very little information on coral disease and parasitism in China. This study provides baseline information for researchers that will carry on the work. The results of this study will give the host country a better understanding of their coral reef ecosystem.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, a catalogue of coral lesions is being made freely available on Dr. Yu's Chinese Academy of Sciences web page. This allows researchers, scientists and the general public to have access to this information. Additionally, results of the study will be presented at scientific meetings and we expect at least one peer-reviewed publication.

The project title is "New Light Particles in the Early Universe." The host scientist is Hitoshi Murayama.<br/><br/>This research project studies the effects of new light particle species on early universe phenomena, such as the synthesis of light elements and the production of residual background radiation. These effects are explored in an effective field theory approach, in order to provide constraints on theories in a model-independent fashion. In addition, this project develops calculational methods to determine the mass of new light particles which become nonrelativistic during the era of recombination, when electrons and protons began to form neutral atoms. These results have significant implications for theoretical models and future experimental research, both in cosmology and elementary particle physics, with the potential to discover new particles and physical phenomena.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.
