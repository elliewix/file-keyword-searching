Abstract: This Partnership for Innovation project from SUNY College of Environmental Science & Forestry will improve and enhance the technology for Hot Water Extraction (HWE) to carefully and completely deconstruct wood. The process that is being developed and applied will sustainably and cost effectively extract highly valuable carbohydrate and chemical assets from wood fiber. The enhanced technology that will result from this research will facilitate the development of valuable bioproducts that increase the rate of commercial implementations. These HWE derived bioproducts will replace similar products which are made from less sustainable and by less efficient means both in the U.S. and abroad. The wood fiber (and its constituent asset elements that will be the focus of this project) is currently primarily being burned for energy. In addition to the production advantages of HWE technology, the production of these products within the forested economic regions where industry needs them will reduce transportation costs and environmental impacts. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project will accelerate the building of capacity and skill to strategically locate, engineer, design, fabricate equipment, and build facilities to efficiently and cost-effectively make products from existing raw materials; frequently on existing underutilized sites. Further, the partners will gain significant technical expertise and market advantage in understanding how to enhance the HWE process for these carbohydrate and chemical products. The broader impacts of this research extend to all forested regions of the U.S. <br/><br/>The Knowledge Enhancement Partners are the lead academic institution , the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry and three small for profit business: 1) Applied Biorefinery Sciences, Syracuse, New York, Dr. Joel Howard; 2) Highland Engineering, Glens Falls, New York ( Mr. Patrick Sullivan, and 3) Miller Mechanical Services, Glens Falls, New York , Ms. Elizabeth Miller. RockTenn is a large for-profit forest products business and a non-KEP partner; the liaison is Dr. Jose Iribarne at the Solvay, NY facility.

Abstract: Program Director's Recommendation <br/>Proposal #1127846 <br/><br/>This project seeks to develop a class of bio-derived, biodegradable, oil dispersants which resist wetting and spreading on solid substrates such as plants and animals. The intellectual merit of this project is that more safe and effective dispersants are needed to help mitigate the impacts of oil spill disasters such as the Deepwater Horizon incident. The PIs have effectively used funds from the NSF RAPID program to identify a class of dispersants that are macromolecular aggregates of natural cellulose polymers and soy bean lecithin. A clear case is made that these compounds do not allow oil to foul bird feathers, and it is presumed that since they are natural in origin, they would be a safer alternative to the current petrochemically derived dispersants. The PIs have a strong record of expertise in this area, and are uniquely suited to this work. They clearly outline a detailed list of scientific and business-related questions that must be answered to push this product to the marketplace. <br/><br/>The broader impact of discovering more effective and non-toxic oil dispersants is clear. The PIs have a strong record of incorporating others into their work, such as the local junior college students and instructors, some of whom are included as inventors of the disclosed technologies. There is a plan for student and workforce training that will span both the academic laboratory and associated industrial partner operations.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating ion exchange fundamentals to fill the gap in brackish water desalination through a Reversible Ion Exchange-Membrane (RIX-M) process. The translated technology has the following unique features: increased product water recovery due to reduction in scaling from sulfate and carbonate salts of calcium on the surface of Reverse Osmosis (RO) membranes without requiring addition of any anti-scaling chemicals. Threats of barium sulfate scaling and consequent fouling of membranes, wherever present, may also be avoided. <br/><br/>The project accomplishes this goal by integrating a self-regenerated ion exchange system along with the RO process. An appropriately designed mixed bed of anion exchange resins significantly reduce sulfate concentration at the membrane inlet, thus avoiding sulfate precipitation. The reject of the RO membrane process is used to regenerate the anion exchange resins without needing addition of external chemicals. <br/><br/>The potential economic impact is expected to be a significant reduction in operating expenses of the desalination plants due to elimination of anti-scaling chemicals. The partnership engages an ion exchange resin manufacturer and an engineering firm to move into the growing brackish water desalination market space globally through validation of the technology under representative conditions. From a business viewpoint, the innovation can also be retrofitted for existing RO plants, thus expanding the market for the proposed technology. <br/><br/>From a broader perspective, the proposed work will also lay the basis for an in-land desalination technology which does not create a reject stream containing environmentally objectionable anti-scaling chemicals requiring post treatment. With higher product water recovery, the reject brine will be smaller in volume, thus reducing the land requirement for disposal. The scientific approach envisioned through fundamentals of ion exchange may also be transplanted in multi-stage evaporative desalination systems to avoid scaling and consequent reduction in heat transfer efficiency of evaporators.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation project from Kent State University, which is partnering with two knowledge-enhancement partner companies and five other academic, industrial and non-profit partners, will establish a broad platform on liquid crystal (LC) - polymer interfaces. LC - polymer interfaces have been of vital importance in the liquid crystal display (LCD) industry since its inception. The recent advent of flexible LCDs using plastic substrates is generating renewed and urgent interest in interface design and associated behavior. The move from glass to soft flexible substrates not only raises new technical problems, but also illuminates old ones. These problems and questions of basic science are exceptionally close and are inextricably linked; the goal of the project is to connect device and manufacturing issues in industry to the frontiers of academic research. The project aims to identify the technical issues in real products of the partner companies and to offer solutions based on the state-of-the-art characterization, computational materials science, and novel materials development. The proposed platform will not only solve key problems in currently emerging technologies, but it will also enable new LC-on-plastic (LCOP) technologies and thereby provide to U.S. industry new opportunities with the potential for strong economic development based on LCOP products. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are potentially large-scale economic opportunities for U.S. display and related industries. A dramatic technological change today is the move of LCDs from glass to plastic substrates. This change represents a tremendous opportunity for U.S. industry to again establish a leadership position and develop and benefit from the emerging LCOP technology. The partnership will disseminate project results through networks in the LC-polymer community and provide a model for future industry-university collaboration in practical problem solving. If the current challenges are overcome, the U.S. will have the opportunity to harness, develop, and cultivate this emerging new technology, with vast technological and economic promise. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project include the Knowledge-Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of Kent State University (Liquid Crystal Institute) and two small businesses: AlphaMicron (AMI) (Kent, OH), and Kent Displays (KDI) (Kent, OH), both of which are the pioneers responsible for the breakthrough demonstrations that LCOP technology is possible. In addition, there are other partners. These partners include other academic institutions: University of Akron and University of Oklahoma; a private sector organization (non-profit): Bridgestone Americas Center for Research Technology; and public sector organizations: Nortech/FlexMatters and Polymer Ohio Inc.

The new knowledge generated will be used to (a) extend the life of material joints within the aging energy infrastructure and (b) increasing efficiency in deploying advanced materials for new energy infrastructure. The focus of the proposed center is to also address the critical need for engineering graduates trained in interdisciplinary methodologies to address materials joining for wide range of energy applications. The PIs are proposing the following research areas: joining of existing materials; joining of new advanced materials; joining of dissimilar materials; additive manufacturing for hybrid materials; and life extension of existing joints. The PIs are well-qualified and have adequate resources to conduct the proposed research. <br/><br/>The proposed center will focus on developing joining methodologies that will eventually become core components of the curriculum within welding and joining engineering programs. The proposed Center will also offer mentoring programs for students from different ethnic backgrounds and underrepresented groups. If successful, the scientific methodologies will be used to develop state-of-the-art simulation tools that could benefit several industries.<br/><br/>The defined concept for the center should provide an increase in the opportunity for different industries to participate in fundamental research. The center should provide an organized structure for drawing interest and projects from industry. In addition, the center should improve the potential for better understanding of advanced joining metallurgy.

Abstract: The proposed project utilizes advances in key classic computer science problems such as search tree restructuring to implement an optimized auction system for acquisition/sale of media advertising time. The proposed system would move away from the current manually negotiated approach to an expressive auction approach in which buyers can express rich preferences and constraints through which they can more effectively conduct their campaigns. The optimization software of the PI currently underlies the nationwide kidney exchange. This effort will scale and adapt the PI's prior work in expressive auctions for transportation and medical markets to match the richness of the TV market. Based on requirements gathering to be undertaken, a prototype application for the TV ad market will be completed. <br/><br/>The proposed work has the potential to reap significant savings though efficiencies and added derived value obtained for the expressive auction approach. This is anticipated by the PI to be anywhere from 13-41% of the current $75B market. Moreover, implementation of these approaches has the potential to create fairer and open markets while consumers benefit from viewing of ads relevant to their interests and needs. The approach has broader application in other areas such as electricity and pollution rights/credits as well as other media markets. The effort has a relationship within an established innovation ecosystem at CMU and a new small company will be launched.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project--a Type III (A:C) partnership between Kansas State University, an NSF PFI graduate (0438691), and Pittsburg State University (PSU), an institution new to the PFI Program (defined as one that has never been a PFI grantee)--seeks to simultaneously develop and formalize a process to accelerate the commercial development of bioscience products, processes and technologies and provide meaningful Early-Stage Technology Development (ESTD) experience to Kansas's future technology engineers and entrepreneurs. This project will accelerate the movement of bioscience discoveries to commercialization for a leading agricultural biotechnology state and region, Kansas. In particular, there is merit in designing ways to produce more value from current bio-based waste streams, including those from ethanol production processing streams. This project represents a new approach to linking world class agriculture and bioscience investments in the state to new innovation methods, particularly scale-up methods for bio-processing.<br/><br/>The project will enhance general economic well being in Kansas. It will increase the transfer of technologies to Kansas companies; stimulate the formation and assist the development of technology-based businesses in Kansas; increase new products brought to market; and provide access to a coordinated Early-Stage Technology Development (ESTD) resource that significantly accelerates the development and hardening of new bioscience-based products, processes, and technologies in Kansas. The major societal impact will be the creation of wealth and high-paying jobs for the citizens of Kansas. In addition, creating a model process that benefits both the technology creator/inventor and the recipient will stimulate transformation of intellectual property created in both company and university laboratories into commercial products. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in education about commercialization activities and thus, Kansas's future technology entrepreneurs will learn to define and conduct successful bioscience ESTD projects. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are Academic Institutions: Kansas State University (lead institutions), Pittsburgh State University (PSU), and Kansas State Olathe-Innovation Campus; Private Sector Organizations: Kansas Environmental Management Associates (KEMA) LLC.; Lifeline Foods (St. Joseph, MO); MGP Ingredients, Inc.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating our KS-Detect system which will represent the first complete ?sample-in-answer-out? solution for the diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in limited resource settings. The translated KS-Detect system combines our (1) ?lab-on-a-syringe? technology for biopsy extraction and sample processing, (2) solar-thermal PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for extremely low-power nucleic acid amplification, and (3) a nanoparticle based colorimetric smartphone assay for the quantification of the results. The system is designed to be used by a field nurse and addresses a number of challenges with low resource setting diagnosis of Kaposi?s sarcoma including: the ability to take and process a biopsy sample in the field, providing at least a 10-fold increase in the number of diagnostic reactions that can be performed on a single battery charge by using sunlight to drive the thermal cycling process, and elimination of the reliance on specialized instrumentation enabling the system to be fixed in the field by the operator. The project accomplishes its objectives by constructing a complete prototype resulting in pre-clinical optimization which is a critical evaluation stage prior to clinical implementation. The partnership engages experts in limited resource setting diagnostics to provide guidance in the field requirements as they pertain to the potential to translate the KS-Detect system along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to be significant in the long term and the project will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in biomedical diagnostics. <br/><br/>The societal impact, long term, will be better diagnostics of Kaposi?s sarcoma. Kaposi's sarcoma is the leading cancer in men and the second leading cancer in women in sub-Saharan Africa. KS is difficult to distinguish from other angioproliferative diseases, particularly in Africa where access to trained pathologists is limited to few hospitals and immunohistochemistry is practically non-existent. Multiple studies have shown that PCR based nucleic acid identification of Kaposi?s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) in skin biopsies represents the best method of performing an unambiguous diagnosis in the absence of immunohistochemistry. In addition to the research activities proposed here, we will develop a series of social media tools to facilitate world-wide sharing of recent scientific and technological advances in limited resource setting diagnostics. Services like Facebook and Twitter are now the dominant method by which information is disseminated across the world, but their adoption by the scientific community has been painfully slow. Here we will use these tools to establish a virtual community of doctors, scientists, engineers, technologists, and field workers interested in limited resource setting diagnostics. New technologies, news articles, results of clinical studies, and other information of interest will be disseminated through these tools to this community.

The proposed research will include establishing methods to design metallic alloys that meet performance requirements while increasing recyclability; developing sensors to identify metals and separation technologies to sort the waste stream; and establishing materials sensors, processes and controls to achieve greater tolerance of scrap metal input for downstream recycling processes. The Center research projects will be multi-disciplinary and will involve faculty and both graduate and under-graduate students from a spectrum of disciplines. <br/><br/>The societal impact of the proposed Center includes the energy savings and emissions reductions that are inherent in increased resource recovery and recycling. Materials recovery and recycling is practiced by diverse and often fragmented supply chain (scrap yards, municipal waste centers and others). The proposed IUCRC plans to bring together industrial members from across this spectrum, and provide a forum where all can gain an understanding of the entire supply chain, identify issues, explore and develop innovative, integrated solutions. Broadening participation is also a top priority for CR3, and will involve underrepresented minorities and women within the Center activities through targeted provision of research and educational opportunities for its graduates at companies that belong to the Center.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity project from the University of Maine at Machias (the easternmost of the seven campuses in the University of Maine System) examines opportunities to create new marine aquaculture jobs and new wealth in east coastal Maine through shellfish research involving two commercially important species: blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and Arctic surfclams (Mactromeris polynyma). Currently, mussels are cultured using juveniles sourced from the wild where spatial and temporal variation in both biotic and abiotic conditions does not allow for consistent annual production schedules. Surfclams are not cultured anywhere at present, and, although present in the Gulf of Maine, are harvested commercially only in the Canadian Maritimes where they are dredged hydraulically at depths greater than 20 meters. The surfclams are flash frozen and only their feet are marketed. The proposed activities advance knowledge and understanding within the field of shellfish aquaculture involving the hatchery, nursery, and growout phases of these two commercial bivalve species that have yet to be produced in shellfish hatcheries in the U.S. The research effort will yield information critical to other researchers and commercial businesses about the parameters that affect growth and survival of each species from early to later life-history stages.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are related to increasing U.S. competitiveness in the seafood industry. For example, since 1990, U.S. mussel imports have increased from 2,600 tons to more than 15,000 tons. Over 90% of the imports come from two countries, New Zealand and Canada, because the domestic supply is inadequate to keep up with consumer demand. Other impacts involve mentoring undergraduate students in teaching, training, and learning through hands-on hatchery and field-based activities that will broaden participation of underrepresented groups (academic and geographic). The academic-small business partnership is fundamental to the shellfish research that creates a stronger, more efficient research infrastructure. As configured, this partnerships will lead to commercialization activities that are sustainable and compatible with the cultural heritage and ecological values of downeast Maine. PI Beal (a Fulbright Scholar) and co-PI Shumway (an Aldo Leopold Fellow) have extensive experience bridging the gap between industry and academia and will be active in the project as well as in outreach activities.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are the lead academic institution, University of Maine at Machias, a public, undergraduate institution of 1,000 students and 100 employees in eastern Maine; and three primary, small technology-based business partners: AC, Inc (Beals, ME), the largest wholesale seafood business in eastern Maine with 23 employees; New DHC Inc. (Machiasport, ME), a salmon aquaculture company in eastern Maine with 55 employees; and, Pemaquid Oyster Company, Inc. (Waldoboro, ME), a shellfish aquaculture company with 6 employees. Other academic and governmental partners include the University of Connecticut, Department of Marine Sciences (Avery Point, CT); Two branches of National Oceanic and Atmoshperic Administration (NOAA): National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in Milford, CT; and National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) in Charleston, SC.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project, Autonomous Robotic Rotorcraft for Exploration, Surveillance, and Transportation (ARREST), from the University of Pennsylvania will create a partnership among small-business entrepreneurs in small rotor-craft and sensors and robotics researchers at the University of Pennsylvania developing autonomous robots. The partnership will enable the translation of fundamental, federally-sponsored, research results into products with societal benefits and commercial impact by implementing a loosely structured, application-focused, "play-like sandbox" environment among its partners. The intellectual merit of this project is derived from four projects aimed at developing products/ technologies enabled by the cross-fertilization of technologies for robotics and Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) and from the establishment of a sandbox to encourage exploration of potential applications and markets for technologies that are being, have been, or can be developed. New research contributions will include the development of small, autonomous micro aerial vehicles and the algorithms/software for sensing, perception, control and navigation without direct human command or intervention. Additionally, the partnership proposes innovation in doctoral education by adding a new dimension to student training to encourage "lateral and analogous thinking." It will consist of structured interactions with technology transfer specialists, inventors, and venture capitalists; collaborative research at the sites of the industrial partners; and new mechanisms for spurring innovation that includes an "inverted X-prize" competition called the "Y-prize," which focuses on the platform as the solution space (instead of as the problem space), thus fostering innovation by generating novel application ideas for using or adapting existing technological solutions and methodologies.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project are the new commercial applications and products that will be identified in collaboration with the knowledge-enhancement partners, and, in addition, the leveraging of already developed technologies to create these products. These products will be of direct use to end-users engaged in first response and also will provide incremental benefits to homeland security and to the military. The partnership will lead to the creation of a new robotics rotorcraft industry and help spawn a new generation of doctoral students, trained in the fundamentals with a depth that has come to be expected in top-notch doctoral programs, but also in the "lateral thinking" that is characteristic of agile, innovative small businesses. The partnership will establish a model for leveraging Department of Defense investment in basic research for dual-use applications and a framework for identifying and pursuing commercial applications that are not directly connected to security, first response, and defense applications. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project include the Knowledge Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of the University of Pennsylvania (GRASP Robotics Laboratory); two small businesses: Dragon Pictures, Inc. (Essington, PA) and EmergentViews (San Francisco, CA); and a large private sector organization: Advanced Technologies Laboratory, Lockheed Martin Corporation. In addition, there are other core partners. These include public sector partners: the City of Philadelphia, and the Southeast Pennsylvania Ben Franklin Technology Partnership and their network of Angel and Venture Investors.

The new knowledge generated will be used to (a) extend the life of material joints within the aging energy infrastructure and (b) increasing efficiency in deploying advanced materials for new energy infrastructure. The focus of the proposed center is to also address the critical need for engineering graduates trained in interdisciplinary methodologies to address materials joining for wide range of energy applications. The PIs are proposing the following research areas: joining of existing materials; joining of new advanced materials; joining of dissimilar materials; additive manufacturing for hybrid materials; and life extension of existing joints. The PIs are well-qualified and have adequate resources to conduct the proposed research. <br/><br/>The proposed center will focus on developing joining methodologies that will eventually become core components of the curriculum within welding and joining engineering programs. The proposed Center will also offer mentoring programs for students from different ethnic backgrounds and underrepresented groups. If successful, the scientific methodologies will be used to develop state-of-the-art simulation tools that could benefit several industries. <br/><br/>The defined concept for the center should provide an increase in the opportunity for different industries to participate in fundamental research. The center should provide an organized structure for drawing interest and projects from industry. In addition, the center should improve the potential for better understanding of advanced joining metallurgy.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation project from the University of Arkansas (UA) will focus on the exploration and definition of an integrated circuit research platform based on silicon carbide (SiC) technology to develop gate driver and digital control circuitry for integration into advanced power electronic modules with the aim of achieving higher performing integrated power electronics in terms of size, weight, efficiency, and robustness. It is these modules that serve as the basic building blocks of a vast array of equipment including electrified transportation; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; energy exploration; renewable energy and storage interfaces; and grid-connected power electronics. With approximately 30% of all power produced in the U.S. passing through a power electronic converter or motor drive before it reaches its end use, it is crucial that power electronic systems operate as reliably and efficiently as possible. The U.S. DoE estimates that this percentage will increase to 80% over the next 15 years. Wide bandgap-based power electronics, particularly those made with SiC, have been shown to vastly reduce losses (> 50%); while simultaneously increasing power density, resiliency, and reliability. Even though part cost is higher for SiC devices versus silicon, in many cases, overall system costs are reduced through simpler thermal management due to the higher temperature performance offered by SiC.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research include developing leading-edge mixed-signal circuitry for use in power electronic modules that will influence a vast array of products used by millions in the U.S. In addition, there are the economic impacts of stimulating the creation of numerous jobs, differentiation in the marketplace for the core partners, and fostering a customer-supplier relationship through the three partners as the technologies mature. With the anticipated growth described above, the market potential for these technologies is clearly in the billions of dollars. Another impact is on an emerging workforce. This project will educate graduate and undergraduate students in building innovation capacity to be followed by accelerating innovations. It will also help to attract K-12 students to the electronics field as a relatively mature research platform undergoes a transformation.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project include the Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Computer Science & Computer Engineering at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville; two small businesses in Fayetteville: Ozark Integrated Circuits and Arkansas Power Electronics International; and Raytheon, a large U.S. company.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project from University of North Texas will create an innovative partnership among farmers, academic researchers, and industrial scientists and engineers to develop kenaf (a plant in the hibiscus family, related to okra and cotton)-based biomaterials for sustainable structured insulated panels for the built environment, especially in zero (net) energy applications. Kenaf is selected because of its ability to grow in arid conditions, where alternative plantings cannot be considered. From an engineering standpoint, it represents a domestic resource that has the same strength to weight ratio as glass fiber. Natural fibers in their as-harvested state have a porous structure that is often destroyed by the industrial processing through alkali treatment. Approaches based on placing the freshly harvested crop in river or pond water are not effective on a large scale. An alternative approach using bacteria based on selectivity for kenaf will be utilized through an academic-farmer partnership. The goal will be to develop technologically viable reinforcements that retain their natural features while reducing the environmental footprint associated with their processing. <br/><br/>The broader impacts from this research arise from the interdisciplinary partnership at all levels of the PFI. A successful effort could yield positive economic, environmental, and energy savings for both residential and commercial buildings, while meeting or exceeding the industrial standards. The platform of new multifunctional materials also has potential applications for commercially viable sustainable building products in many sectors (e.g., aerospace, packaging, and transportation). Efforts to integrate fiber process modifications will translate to job creation in rural segments with value-added markets improving the investment returns. The work is inherently interdisciplinary-- incorporating a variety of areas of engineering (biochemical, green, mechanical, and structural) and life cycle analysis--and through small-group interactive processes, promotes the direct involvement of graduate students early in the innovation value chain. Innovative academic-industrial research activities will be integrated with socially responsible entrepreneurship training, where doctoral students in each department will work together as an interdisciplinary Venture team, merging business and engineering innovation with sustainability concepts. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project include the Knowledge-Enhance Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of the University of North Texas, two small businesses: InnoVida Southeast (Miami, FL) and Ladonia Market Center (Ladonia, TX); and a federal agency: Agricultural Research Service, USDA (Lane, OK). In addition, there is another academic partner: Florida International University (Miami, FL).

Abstract: This Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) project brings together major companies and universities in the development of a wireless communications ecosystem to commercialize breakthrough technologies that promise to increase the capacity of today's wireless cellular networks by over 1000 times. Specifically, three existing technologies will be relied upon to create a prototype stage for integration by wireless handset makers and infrastructure providers as well as incorporation into next-generation cellular standards. These technologies are: (i) millimeter-wave (mmWave) cellular systems that can move cellular communication to new bands between 20 and 120 GHz where between 50 and 100 times more spectrum are readily available; (ii) relaying and distributed coordination techniques to enable ultra low-cost small, self-organizing cells that increase the numbers of cell sites by orders of magnitude; and (iii) full duplex communication that can double communication bandwidth and facilitate beamforming techniques essential for mmWave cellular systems.<br/><br/>Given the enormous market size of the cellular industry ($1 trillion worldwide), combined with the pressing need for solutions to solve the spectrum crunch, the breakthrough technologies in this proposal will offer tremendous market value, return on investment, and opportunities for employment. This AIR project provides a path for both industry and academia to develop key products and knowledge that will impact the standard-setting process of the wireless industry, while bringing massive increases in data throughputs to cellular networks throughout the U.S.

Abstract: Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), Cornell University, and commercial partners ITT-Geospatial Systems, Lockheed-Martin, and Pictometry International propose to establish the Consortium for 3D Innovation (C3I), an effort dedicated to translating innovative 3D research and development to the commercial sector. The consortium will (i) leverage 3D algorithm research by RIT and Cornell through a non-exclusive, royalty free intellectual property (IP) agreement, (ii) combine technical expertise at RIT and Cornell with business/marketing know-how from commercial partners, facilitated through the Saunders College of Business at RIT, and (iii) educate the next generation 3D innovators in the form of imaging science, computer science, and business students that are affiliated with C3I. The intellectual merits of the effort are underscored by the market need for 3D spatial products, the readiness of existing R&D to transition to market, and lack of a vehicle to accomplish technology transfer.<br/><br/>Society, students and faculty will benefit broadly from the proposed plan of activities. The project flow follows the model of RIT's NSF funded Science Masters Program in Decision Support Technologies for Environmental Forecasting and Disaster Response which requires students to understand fundamentals of business, markets, and entrepreneurism in participation with the Business School. Dissemination of the results of the work will be in keeping with the regular publication of non-proprietary academic achievements and through the commercialization of image analysis and rendering products. The benefits to society will come through the adoption of these products, aided by the creation of a significant number of skilled workers in the field.

Abstract: The NSF I/UCRC Water and Environmental Technology (WET) Center, in partnership with the Ben Franklin Technology Partners (BFTP), propose to establish a Water Technology Innovation Ecosystem to advance the commercialization of new water treatment technologies. The goal for this Partnership is to assure long term growth and sustainability as a regional innovation ecosystem. This partnership will assist manufacturing industries, municipal wastewater and drinking water treatment plants, equipment vendors and engineering design firms in providing solutions to water and wastewater issues. Center engineers and scientists utilizing microbial, chemical, hydrologic, and mathematic approaches will work collaboratively to perform the translational research. Faculty and students will work with industry representatives and build upon their research dealing with water quality and emerging contaminants, and learn about entrepreneurship. The overriding intellectual merit of the resulting Innovation Ecosystem will be the impact of industrial need-focused translational research and commercialization programs, which will enhance scientific and business understanding to address a major health and environmental problem. <br/><br/>The Innovation Ecosystem will involve faculty researchers, graduate and undergraduate students working creatively with industrial representatives. The Ecosystem will further enhance the ongoing efforts of integrating research in classroom teaching. Many member companies have international operations, and students will be exposed to regulatory, technological, social and cultural aspects of different countries, enhancing their global experience. The Innovation Ecosystem will involve the Temple University Science and Mathematics Assessment and Research for Teachers (TU-SMART), whose mission is to improve the infrastructure for K-12 STEM teaching and learning and student performance in the Philadelphia region; and the NSF-funded Science of Learning Center at Temple with focus on educating children. Results from research projects will be presented at Conferences and published in scientific journals and business magazines. The Innovation Ecosystem will result in significant revenue growth and creation of high technology jobs in impacted companies across the US.

Abstract: 1068028 CUNY City College; David Crouse <br/>1068040 Clarkson University; S. V. Babu <br/>1068050 University of North Carolina at Charlotte; Michael Fiddy <br/><br/>The Center for Metamaterials (CfM) will focus on increasing the metamaterials research infrastructure in the U.S., and to educate and train students in the science and application of metamaterials. CUNY City College, Clarkson University (CU), and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with CUNY as the lead institution. <br/><br/>Metamaterials are composite structures that exhibit extraordinary optical or acoustical properties including negative index of refraction, light harvesting, trapping, circulation, anomalous transmission of light, and many other properties not possible with naturally occurring materials or conventional optical components. Industrial applications for these new materials includes building perfect lenses, light harvesting for renewable energy devices and building new high performance sensors. This proposal seeks to develop an I/UCRC program that will perform industrially relevant metamaterials research leading to quick and cost-effective transition of metamaterials technology from US based university research laboratories to industry. The program involves three institutions with various strengths that can supplement theoretical understanding, device manufacturing, and characterization of a variety of metamaterial concepts. The three main technical foci of the CfM Center for Metamaterials that have attracted industry interest include: Theory and Anomalous Behavior, Materials and Structures Development, and Fabrication Process Development. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts include the enhancement of metamaterials R&D and technology transfer infrastructure, student training (including minority students at many of the minority serving colleges within CUNY) in an emerging high technology field, training of CfM member companies' workforce through the CfMs Education and Outreach Program. Additionally, long term economic impact is expected through high technology job creation and the formation of metamaterials spin-off companies, and increased revenue for US based high technology companies.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating atomic layer deposition technology (ALD) to create UV protective thin films onto porous substrates, including nonwoven fiber mats and textiles. Materials used in outdoor protective structures, architectural or decorative elements, and construction are limited by degradation in sunlight or other harsh exposure. The ALD technology is a unique approach to create ultra-thin and ultra-conformal coating layers onto polymer fibers with complex geometries. These coatings have the capacity to protect the underlying polymer from damaging ultraviolet exposure from the sun or other light sources. The coatings can compete with relatively expensive solution-dyed acrylic materials that now dominate the outdoor textile market. The coating can work with a range of material substrates beyond those currently used. Technology implementation requires new knowledge of process scaling and reactor design challenges. <br/><br/>The project accomplishes this goal by exploring a unique "flow-through" reactor design prototype resulting in a demonstration vehicle to evaluate materials and process throughput capabilities to meet market demands. The project engages VaporPulse Technologies to provide guidance in the field of coatings on fibers as well as expertise in project commercialization and marketing as they pertain to the potential to translate the science/technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The technology could have commercial impact well beyond UV protection. Other fiber systems that can benefit from improved coatings include filtration and separations media, personal protective equipment, electronic and medical textiles, or engineered fibers or fabrics for military personnel. In the long term, society will benefit by having materials and products that provide safe and reliable operation under harsh and variable outdoor conditions for longer times at lower cost. The work will also have long-term impact by expanding foundational understanding of thin film reaction science and engineering with impact in many other future fields. This project will also help educate a PhD student in Chemical Engineering to learn the challenges of technology translation from a lab to a small business, allowing those skills to be expanded and passed on in the future.

Abstract: This NSF Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) project will develop commercial-grade solid state transformer (SST) related technology and conduct field trials at a major distribution power grid location. Today's existing distribution transformer lacks the ability to send or receive signals, make decisions, regulate power flow, and easily accommodate green technology (including renewable generation). The SST changes this with the use of power electronics and is often assimilated with internet hubs, as information flows similarly and decisions are automatically made at this utility/customer intersection. <br/><br/>Named as one of the top ten technologies that can change our life by MIT Technology Review in 2011, the SST is a smart device for integrating renewable energy, electric vehicle, and energy storage into the distribution grid. There is a significant interest to see that this technology is transferred to the market place to benefit U.S. industry and electric utilities. The SST is a critical component for microgrid environments and offers many potential features that will be required in the next generation distribution grid. The AIR project not only is to achieve a comprehensive and impressive list of SST functionalities in smart grid application, but also to do so with an innovative SST design at a cost acceptable to the market place.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity project from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) will integrate the latest innovations in polymer chemistry, bioengineering, and medicine to advance development of a novel biocompatible glue toward medical use as a surgical sealant. For years, chemists and materials scientists have been working to design a biocompatible adhesive that can seal tissue inside the wet environment of the human body. A polymer with the desired characteristics (strong wet adhesion, nontoxic and non-immunogenic, stable under physiological conditions, and flexible for use with soft organs and membranes) has now been synthesized at Caltech. This PFI: BIC project will focus on completing the early translational research tasks (in vivo efficacy and biocompatibility demonstrations; optimization of glue chemistry and formulation for mass-production) to take this discovery to a practicable, market-valued solution that will fill the presently unmet need for a biomedical adhesive that works in wet conditions. This process will also involve development of a novel delivery device that incorporates advances in sensor technology to detect the proper location for glue deposition inside the body.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research include enabling new and safer procedures in several areas of medicine (prenatal diagnosis and therapy, vascular surgery, drug delivery, tissue engineering) as well as development of a new class of devices with self-contained sensing mechanisms that enable controlled access and/or delivery of a substance to a precise location in the body. This project also provides opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students to participate in the exciting process of translating research discoveries to realities and to witness first-hand the potential for innovation that can be realized by integrating academic and industry knowledge from multiple fields. Small business partners will benefit from a competitive advantage in the new market niches created from development of the adhesive and sensing delivery device, creation of new intellectual property, and development of new technical capabilities and expertise, resulting in increased innovation capacity and competitiveness.<br/>Partners at the inception of the project are lead academic institution University of California, San Francisco (Departments of Surgery and Bioengineering & Therapeutic Sciences); small technology-based business partners: Modified Polymer Components, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA) and Bay Materials, LLC (Menlo Park, CA); and collaborating academic partner California Institute of Technology (Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering).

Abstract: This NSF Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) project will comprise a substantial national effort to translate nanophotonic and nanoplasmonic research discoveries into innovative products in biosensing applications. A challenge for the implementation of these biosensors relates to methods of delivering power to drive those sensors for the targeted bio-feedback. This AIR project proposes to use nanoplasmonic metamaterial methods to model and demonstrate a compact directional power harvesting system that relies on subwavelength-scale arrayed structures to yield a rectifying antenna or rectenna. A prototype system shows promise for improvements to the key wireless power transmission metric, specific power density, by at least an order of magnitude to ~0.1 W/g.<br/><br/>If successful, the outcomes of this AIR project would revolutionalize power delivery to portable sensors and equipment and transform the design space for implanted biosensors that measure and control biological functions in vivo.

Abstract: This Partnership for Innovation Project from the Polytechnic Institute of New York University (NYU-POLY) addresses the need to develop bioplastics that, in addition to being biobased and offering a desirable environmental footprint, will also provide future customers with improved performance characteristics over existing materials. To do so is critical in order to motivate consumers to renounce current petro-derived materials for new-to-the-world bioplastics such as those proposed herein. The strategy pursued by the project team is to utilize bioplastics with the right combination of properties while focusing on engineering the interface or boundaries between these components to optimize material performance. Specifically, selected material components include cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs), poly (omega-hydroxyfatty acids (P (omega-OHFAs)), and poly (lactic acid) (PLA). While P (omeg-OHFAs) provides good hydrolytic stability and physical toughness, the PLA-CNW nanocomposites provide high modulus and improved use temperatures. The knowledge-enhance partner (KEP) small businesses in this project, PolyNew Inc. (engineered CNWs) and SyntheZyme LLC (P(omega-OHFAs) and their blends with PLA), bring together the required technologies to exploit synergies that will result by the judicious combination of materials to provide superior performance 100% biobased bioplastics. The production of omega-OHFAs will be performed by using SyntheZyme's newly engineered yeast strain that provides the first efficient biotechnological route to convert fatty acids to omega-HOFAs. P(omega-HOFAs) have properties similar to medium density polyethylene (PE). However, unlike PE, P(omega-HOFAs) contain ester groups separated by 13 to 17 methylene (CH2) units. Thus, P(omega-HOFAs) provide important PE-like properties such as water resistance and excellent ductility while retaining chemical reactivity so they can be reactive blended with PLA and strengthened by CNWs. PolyNew Inc. and SyntheZyme LLC will work together to develop technologies by which CNWs are functionalized to engineer interactions with blended P(omega-HOFAs) and PLAs. The impressive performance of CNWs derives from their aspect ratio that enables them to reach their percolation threshold (e.g., where long-range connectivity is achieved within the material) at relatively low loadings, resulting in impressive modulus increases. Preliminary work has shown that P (omega-OHFAs)/PLA blends show promising properties that would greatly benefit by incorporation of specifically functionalized CNWs. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research to society at large are many. The project is consistent with Federal policies supporting greater use of biobased products including the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, which is designed to ensure that a sufficiently large base of new, non-food, non-feed biomass crops is established to meet demands for renewable energy and bioproducts. Socially, there are advantages associated with employment in the plastics, forestry and agriculture sectors of the economy--the project strongly supports Green Jobs creation. Reductions in petroleum dependence (even relatively modest ones) are also considered beneficial. Teaching and training will be promoted and considerable outreach activities will be pursued. Previous success in incorporating underrepresented groups (women, Hispanics, and African Americans) in research activities will be continued.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are the Knowledge-Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of NYU-POLY (Brooklyn, NY) and two small businesses partner companies: SyntheZyme LLC (Brooklyn, NY), a small business with private stock holders; and PolyNew Inc. (Golden, CO), a privately held woman-owned small business.

Abstract: This proposal leverages prior NSF funded work that resulted in the patent of a self-powered piezo-floating-gate (PFG) wireless sensor. The sensor is ultra low power and capable of storing strain data, making it highly suitable for embedding in safety-critical physical structures and infrastructure for structural health monitoring via wireless RFID readers over the lifetime of the structure. The proposed effort will address the technological gaps necessary to lead to a robust prototype and subsequent manufacture and commercialization, namely development of all supporting sensing circuitry and wireless interface circuitry and software, demonstrating remote configuration and interrogation of the PFG wireless sensor. <br/><br/>The PFG wireless sensor when incorporated into a prototype system via the proposed work, has the potential to have significant impact in the health monitoring and fault diagnosis of large classes of systems for which such monitoring systems must be autonomous, self-contained, generate their own power and be zero-maintenance. As a result such sectors as civil infrastructure, biomedical devices and systems, individual and civil transportation, and energy represent potential markets. Adoption of such embedded sensor elements in the safety critical systems used in these sectors can ultimately result in fewer injuries and fatalities arising from unexpected system failures.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation project from the University at Albany a.k.a. SUNY Albany (College of Nanoscale Science & Engineering (CNSE)), in collaboration with key players from the private sector and government, focuses on the area of silicon nanowire (SiNW)-related nanotechnology innovations and discoveries to optimize the properties of energy devices through the integration of SiNW materials with controlled interfaces and desired physical and chemical properties that will allow more widespread implementation of this platform technology. CNSE's unique fabrication capabilities of nanostructured materials will enable the production of interface geometries, defect structures, and atomic arrangements not otherwise possible in materials produced by traditional methods. In turn, the investigation of carrier generation, charge distribution, surface migration and charge transfer on uniquely tailored surfaces leading to better understanding and processing of these materials will be enabled. Additionally, new shared knowledge will determine how to best integrate one- and three-dimensional Si-based nanostructures and how such processes can be appropriately scaled economically.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are on energy efficiency and clean energy technology. The project proffers advances in energy devices, including solar cells, thermoelectric devices, and batteries through improvements in SiNW architectures and nanostructured materials. This activity will build on the work of CNSE's broader incubation, commercialization, and "partnerships for innovation" efforts; which focus on connecting university-based research and development activities with private enterprise funding and expertise, which, in turn, will help increase the rate and scale of clean energy technology market penetration across the region and country. This program is expected to develop and ultimately commercialize innovations and create economic development opportunities, resulting in green jobs in the U.S., as well as ensuring independent and secure energy resources for the nation. In addition to technology development outcomes of this project, for the first time, three small business industrial partners at CNSE will get to experience and contribute to the power of leveraging the circular open innovation model. The knowledge sharing within this technology platform will result in a pipeline of new capacity with new and existing industry partners. This approach will make CNSE's new technology capabilities openly accessible to external users, allowing these outsiders to expand on and remix the core product in surprising new ways. Anticipated to arise out of input from external users will be improvement on the innovations and creation of new value that CNSE and its partners may ultimately be able to use in other industry segments. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project include the Knowledge Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of University of Albany (College of Nanoscale Science & Engineering), and three small businesses: Magnolia Solar Corporation (Woburn, MA and Albany, NY), Hi-Z Technology (San Diego, CA), and B.E.S.S. Technologies (Albany, NY). In addition, there are other core partners (from the state of New York unless otherwise indicated). They include private sector organizations: CG Power, EYP/Energy, New Energy New York, and Salem Financial; these partners will provide market deployment opportunities, assist in network building and strategic partnerships, and help define specifications for renewable energy products developed by the KEP; public sector organizations: including the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) (Golden, CO), New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), and New York State Empire State Development (NYSESD); these partners will support technology development, technology transfer assistance and competitive economic development assistant grants to the KEP; and other partner organizations: ECG Consulting, Heslin Rothenberg Farley Mesiti, and the Hudson Valley Center for Innovation; these partners will provide business mentoring and business planning support to the KEP.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project from the University of Nevada Reno (UNR) has two primary objectives: to develop novel precast concrete bridge elements to resist loads such as earthquakes, hurricanes, etc., without being damaged and to develop connection and column products that can be disassembled and recycled. Meeting these objectives will provide essential elements for a new paradigm, "Highway for Life (HFL)," an expression created by the Federal Highway Administration for the U.S. highway industry to capture the idea of advancing long lasting highways through innovation. In this study, novel materials with demonstrated potential through past studies by the PI and four knowledge-enhancement partner (KEP) small businesses will be adopted. Several modular elements will be developed consisting of Nickel-Titanium shape memory alloys, built-in elastomeric pads, engineered cementitious composites, and fiber-reinforced polymer structural members. Large-scale structural models will be built and tested to evaluate performance under large deformations and to identify measures to improve and refine the connections. The proposed research will be collaborative; involving an extensive exchange of ideas, information, and knowledge enabled by using regularly scheduled face-to-face or cyber-assisted meetings among the principal investigator and KEP business members. The existing mechanisms at UNR Technology Transfer Office to protect intellectual property of the PIs and of the small business partners will be used to facilitate the project. A project advisory board consisting of representatives from state and federal highway agencies will review the proposed designs and provide feedback to maximize the probability of acceptance of the connections in bridge construction.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are new connection and column products with potential new markets in the U.S. and other countries, especially for the knowledge enhancement partner small businesses involved in this project. The potential benefits to the travelling public are damage-free bridges that could remain functional even after disastrous events such as hurricanes and earthquakes. Emergency response vehicles such as ambulances and fire trucks will be able to continue to use the highway system and provide the much needed service without delays. The impact on the general public is a more efficient use of materials and energy and less pollution because sustainable and recyclable bridges save tremendous amounts of energy. The direct educational impact of the project is the knowledge that the UNR team, including graduate and undergraduate students, and the small business partners will gain by closely working with each other. It is the intent of the project to engage undergraduate students in a research context which is both challenging and purposeful, so as to motivate them to pursue graduate education. The tests of the novel materials will be webcast with the testing schedule widely announced to maximize the number of online visitors. The findings from this study will be posted on the project website. Furthermore, presentations to various technical groups will be made and the highlights of the project will be incorporated in two advanced structural engineering courses. To maximize the probability of involvement of underrepresented groups, the PI will work with the UNR McNair program (a program aimed at increasing the number of doctoral students from underrepresented groups) and seek assistance in identifying potential talented students at the undergraduate and PhD level who could work on the project. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are the Knowledge-Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of the University of Nevada Reno (the structural engineering program of the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department and the Technology Transfer Office) and four small businesses: Dynamic Isolation Systems (DIS), Inc. (McCarran, NV), FiberMatrix, Inc. (Sparks, NV), Hexel Fyfe Co. LLC (San Diego, CA) and Nitinol Technology, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Other partners are public sector organizations: Federal Highway Administration, California Department of Transportation, South Carolina Department of Transportation, and State of Washington Department of Transportation.

Abstract: This PFI:BIC project from the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering-University at Albany seeks to develop cost-effective oxygen sensors for combustion applications. Oxygen sensors are currently the most extensively used sensor in the combustion industry. These sensors are used for controlling fuel injection in gasoline-powered vehicles (cost of sensors ~ $100) and optimizing combustion in coal-fired power plants (cost of sensor ~ $5000). Currently, the dimensions of these sensor systems range from ten centimeters to meters in size and require access to ambient air, thus limiting their use in a wide range of industries. Miniaturization of existing sensor designs only will be advantageous if new designs no longer need access to ambient air. The recent discovery of an oxygen sensor by Argonne National Laboratory and The Ohio State University with unsurpassed oxygen-sensing capabilities and no need for access to outside air, provides a unique opportunity to further adapt miniaturization for designing innovative chemical gas sensors. The intellectual merit of this program is realized in filling the technology gap related to the development of microfabrication techniques for producing millimeter- sized oxygen gas sensors with the necessary technical and cost attributes required for widespread use within combustion applications. To meet this objective, manufacturing practices for macroscopic ceramic objects will be translated to the nanometer length scale, which will increase the innovation capacity of the research team. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research will be realized in the commercial impact of microfabricated oxygen sensors. Use of these miniaturized sensors will increase the combustion efficiency of energy systems in industries that include transportation, energy generation, and manufacturing. An increase of just 1% in combustion efficiency will provide energy savings of 160 TBtu with a subsequent CO2 reduction of 93 million tons, saving billions of dollars in the long run with a major impact on a cleaner environment. For the small business collaborator, Makel Engineering, Inc.( MEI), these sensors can be used immediately in low volume/high cost industrial applications. In the long term, mass-produced sensor dies will allow for a reduction in production costs that will then open up low cost/high volume chemical sensor applications. For the small business collaborator, MicroAdventure Technologies LLC (MAT), the successful completion of the MEMS oxygen sensor project will allow MAT to participate in the subsequent development phases needed to bring this sensor technology to market. Longer term, MAT intends to participate in the supply chain for this sensor by providing custom-designed and tested die to application-focused companies. For the academic members of the research team, the translation of laboratory discoveries into research initiatives aimed at building the innovation capacity of small businesses will in turn provide new educational opportunities for both the academic investigators and students. The entrepreneurial spirit of this research program will provide a unique opportunity for training of graduate and undergraduate students and the groundwork for future success in both academic and business-related opportunities.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are as follows: 1) Lead Institution: College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering-University at Albany-SUNY, 2) Primary Small Business Partners: MEI, Chico, CA, and MAT, Pittsford, NY, and 3) Other primary partner: The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Ohio State University

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity project from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) plans to capitalize on the recent advances in the synthesis of diamond by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in order to develop the next generation of diamond-based sensors for extreme environments and diamond-coatings for higher-power solid state lasers and longer-lasting biomedical implants. Developments in the synthesis of diamond over the last three decades have made it possible to grow mono-, poly-, and nano-crystalline diamond on various surfaces. Combining UAB's existing research expertise and intellectual property in the synthesis of CVD diamond with the technological-oriented research to be performed in this project will lead to the development of 1) novel diamond-based sensors for characterizing materials under extreme environments; 2) CVD diamond-coated laser media for improved heat dissipation; and 3) diamond-coated biomedical implants with lifespan extending over thirty years. This project aims to address the difficulties encountered in and ways to improve on the adhesion of CVD diamond films on laser media and biomedical implant materials like stainless steel and cobalt-chrome alloys. The research will also contribute to the knowledge base on the growth mechanisms of diamond single crystals as well as on the growth of nanostructured diamond coatings on metallic and non-metallic substrates.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are enhanced innovative capacities of the academic institution and the industrial partner companies. The research proposed in this project will result in diamond crystals with embedded electrical, magnetic, and stress sensors for applications in extreme conditions of pressures and temperatures. The increase in lifespan of biomedical implants will improve the quality of life for millions of Americans and will reduce the need for revision surgeries. The diamond-coated laser media with minimal loss and high damage threshold will enable new laser applications in industry and medicine. UAB postdoctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students will benefit from the exposure they will receive by working in close contact with the industry personnel. Also, by partnering with Birmingham Business Alliance (BBA), an economic development organization focused on the economic growth in the seven-county Birmingham region, this project will have a broader impact in the nucleation of new businesses in the innovation depot in the downtown Birmingham area.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are 1) Lead Institution: University of Alabama (Department of Physics) and 2) Small Business Partners: Almax easyLab Inc.(headquartered in Boston, MA); Onyx Optics Inc.(Dublin, CA); and Vista Engineering & Consulting LLC (Birmingham, AL).

Abstract: I/UCRC for Energy Harvesting Materials and Systems <br/><br/>1035042 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University; Daniel Inman <br/>1035024 University of Texas, Dallas; Bruce Gnade <br/><br/>The Center for Energy Harvesting Materials and Systems ((CEHMS) will focus on recovery (harvesting) of unused energy from various sources such as radio and television towers, satellites and various portable electronics. Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VT) and the University of Texas, Dallas (UTD) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with VT as the lead institution. <br/><br/>The proposal seeks a grant for a new multi-university Center for Energy Harvesting Materials and Systems to focus on energy harvesting approaches. The focus of research within this center will be to investigate a wide range of potential energy harvesting opportunities in power systems, human activity, industrial machines, vehicles, vibrating structures and other such sources. While the energy harvested in any one of the opportunities is small, the accumulation effect can be very significant. The proposed researchers have identified some unique and creative opportunities to assess the value and potential for harvesting energy that would otherwise be untapped. The research is important to the US and much of the world in efforts to capture new sources of energy. The reduction in dependence on foreign oil is always of significant value. The PIs have excellent credentials for conducting the research effort, and the involvement of a number of qualified researchers from the two collaborative universities is impressive. The proposal is very well written and the project descriptions are clear and well documented. The research tasks are appropriate and appear to be very well conceived. <br/><br/>The proposed Center has the potential to improve sustainability and profitability of US manufacturing firms by developing new technologies that will reduce energy consumption and harvest energy that is normally wasted. The proposal uses a diverse group of researchers to develop new technologies that can be used in developing new industries, new jobs, new products and new services in the future. The research team is made up of various ethnic and gender groups that have a variety of educational and professional experiences including minority and disadvantage groups. The technologies that are developed by this proposal have the potential to have a large economical impact by producing jobs in new industries and reducing the need for existing fossil fuels. The plan for involving underrepresented students and faculty in the center is very well presented and appropriate. The research program will enhance the already impressive infrastructure at the two universities. Because of the wide range of topics, the dissemination of the results will be primarily through publications and industry meeting. The students involved with the program will be well prepared to enter the workforce and provide additional technology transfer.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project--a Type II (A:B) partnership between Syracuse University, an NSF PFI graduate (0227879, initiated at Tufts University), and Virginia Tech University, which is currently a research site of another NSF-supported partnership program: I/UCRC Wireless Internet Center for Advanced Technology (WICAT) (0809036)--is focused on the creation of the first national Wireless Grid Innovation Testbed (WGiT). The project integrates prior knowledge and technology. Scientists at universities will work with a consortium of private organizations in a laboratory with the resources to support open innovation and user-created innovations in a system that supports their capture, documentation, and improvement. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the innovative combination of grid networking and wireless networking. The ultimate vision of the wireless grid is that of an adaptive network with secure, inexpensive, and coordinated real-time access to dynamic, heterogeneous resources, across geographic, political and cultural boundaries without forsaking stability, transparency, scalability, control and flexibility. Better assessment of wireless grids technology, network performance, and user behavior will inform design, manufacturing and commercialization of next generation information and resource sharing innovations. The test bed will support training and courses related to innovation, wireless grids technologies and business/social impact opportunities. Students within a variety of courses from middle school through doctoral levels, as well as community workforce training programs, through work at the associated labs and in the field, will be given the opportunity of hands-on experience in the use of the wireless grid beta applications as they become available. Students will have the opportunity to develop their own wireless grid applications, building upon the open platform provided. New knowledge will be generated both on innovation models and entrepreneurial ecosystems, and on wireless grids. <br/><br/>The broader impact of wireless grid connectivity specifications developed with WGiT support will be determined ultimately by their utility to user and device communities. Open source developers interested in wireless grids distributed collaboration and network mash-up features will be significant early users. A wide range of new applications is expected across industry sectors and social communities. Businesses, government agencies and private individuals will have new options for interacting within and across regions. The testbed will provide students, faculty, firms, and representatives of government an opportunity to learn from and participate in the growth of this new market. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are Academic Institutions: Syracuse University (lead institution), Virginia Tech University, Tufts University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Instituto Superior Technico (IST), Lisbon, Portugal; Private Sector Organizations: Center for Advanced Engineering & Research, Inc.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation project from the University of Rochester will focus on the application of a breakthrough membrane technology called porous nanocrystalline silicon (pnc-Si) to microscale preparative and analytical systems. In the first phase, the team will work to include the pnc-Si membranes in an existing device for portable pathogen detection. In this device the membranes will be used as a microfilter preventing aggregates from reaching detectors where they can cause false positive signals. In the second phase, the team will use the pnc-Si platform to miniaturize each step in the Integrated Nanotechnologies (INT) process to perform all reaction and detection steps on a single lab-on-a-chip device.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are many. The project is expected to decrease the time-to-market for the INT device, addressing a long-standing need of the U.S. military for remote pathogen detection from small blood samples. The miniaturized device is expected to significantly reduce costs of this device and expand its penetration into nondefense markets. More broadly, the knowledge enhancement partners (KEP) will focus on the use of pnc-Si as a platform technology for pumping and separation in lab-on-a-chip devices. This is expected to have an impact on diverse industries, from biotechnology to the food industry, where lab-on-a-chip solutions are sought to reduce the cost of complex processes. Increased demand for products from the KEP's industrial partners is expected to spur economic growth in the Rochester area. The project will also involve students in the University of Rochester's new Technical Entrepreneurship and Management program who will develop business plans, conduct market research, and perform risk assessment. The project will employ underrepresented minorities through the University of Rochester's McNair program.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are Academic: the lead academic institution, the University of Rochester (Departments of Biomedical Engineering, Simon School of Business; Center for Entrepreneurship) and an academic partner, Rochester Institute of Technology (Departments of Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering); and Small businesses: SiMPore Inc. (West Henrietta, NY), and Integrated Nanotechnologies (Henrietta, NY). SiMPore is the exclusive manufacturer of pnc-Si, an ultrathin nanoporous membrane developed at UR. The devices developed will be based on INT's proprietary process for fully automated, portable pathogen detection. Both small companies are based in the greater Rochester area. RIT faculty will provide the KEP with expertise in miniaturization, electrokinetic flows and LOC devices.

Abstract: This NSF Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) project will establish a public-private ecosystem for the development and implementation of innovative strategies for non-destructive characterization and assessment of pharmaceutical oral dosage forms targeted to continuous manufacturing processes. Non-destructive testing also impacts the quality of health-care treatment, circumventing the issues posed by destructive testing, in which dosages given to patients can never be tested. Non-destructive testing additionally can provide a foundation to better understand critical scientific issues such as within-patient and patient-to-patient response variability since the variability associated with the manufacturing process can be de-convoluted by this approach. <br/><br/>Enabling non-destructive testing has significant economic impact on the quality and control of therapeutics. From an economic perspective, non-destructive testing can provide a pathway for advancing Real-Time Release Testing (RTRT), which has the potential to reduce manufacturing costs associated with large captive waiting-for-release inventories and failed batches. Moreover, non-destructive testing can provide a competitive edge for high-quality U.S.-based manufacturing by retaining and expanding U.S. manufacturing jobs in the pharmaceutical sector.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation project from Northern Arizona University (NAU) uses a commercially available, state-of-the-art, powered foot-ankle prosthesis (the iWalk BioM) as a research platform to develop and test a new theory (the 'winding filament' theory) of how muscles work, with the goal of emulating biological actuation in man-made devices. The project integrates biological inspiration and engineering expertise within a business and economic development context. To achieve these goals, engineers at iWalk will modify a prosthesis prototype so that the winding filament model can be integrated into the existing control software. At NAU, engineers will code the winding filament model to fit the required architecture. The modified prosthesis will be provided to engineers at NAU and Electric Torque Machines, a business that will install the algorithms in the prosthesis. Once the new algorithms are installed, three participants with amputation will wear the prosthesis in a series of experiments designed to compare the kinematics, kinetics, energetics and adaptability of walking with the conventional vs. the modified prosthesis. The competitive landscape in powered prosthetic devices will be analyzed and a commercialization strategy will be developed. If the project is successful, the winding filament model will become a market-accepted innovation for controlling a wide range of powered devices, including prostheses, exoskeletons, and robots. The project will also further the understanding of control principles involved in muscle-like actuation.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research will enhance the innovation and economic competitiveness of the knowledge enhancement partner (KEP) companies by developing new control algorithms for controlling prosthetic and other devices, including exoskeletons and robots. The innovations have the potential to improve the quality of life for millions of disabled Americans. The long-term goal is to design robotic muscles that, like human muscles, will adapt instantaneously and automatically to changes in the loading environment during operation. This academe/business collaboration will stimulate the technology-based business environment that is growing around NAU's academic community. The project will provide interdisciplinary training in biology, engineering, and business for undergraduate and graduate students and educational advancement for professional engineers. The project has the potential transform the understanding of muscle function and human motor control.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are NAU (Departments of Mechanical Engineering and of Biological Sciences and Office of the VP for Research), iWalk, Inc. (Bedford, MA), Electric Torque Machines (ETM), Inc. (Flagstaff, AZ), and NAU Ventures (Flagstaff, AZ). Each of the partners brings significant expertise and experience to the collaborative effort. The iWalk BioM prosthesis represents the state-of-the-art in prosthesis design to emulate the function of the human foot-ankle, with several patents for innovative technology. ETM has a proven track record of commercializing novel motors and controllers featuring unique but practical architectures and designs, with significant improvements in efficiency and high continuous torque. NAU has patented a linear actuator inspired by basic research on how muscles work.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating our recent discovery of pharmaceutical crystallization inhibitors based on novel cellulose omega-carboxyalkanoates to improve the delivery of poorly water soluble drugs by formulating amorphous solid dispersions with enhanced processing and drug delivery characteristics. The translated novel polymeric materials have the following unique features: tailored amphiphilicity and high degree of substitution with carboxylic acid groups that provides exemplary crystallization inhibition of supersaturated solutions of hydrophobic drugs when compared to the leading competing polymer, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, used in the formulation of amorphous solid dispersions in this market space. The project accomplishes this goal by synthesis of novel derivatives of cellulose designed to interact with poorly water soluble drugs which will be used in prototype amorphous solid dispersions formulations which are expected to lead to elevated concentrations of the drug and ultimately improved delivery of the therapeutic agent to the patient. Demonstration of the successful production of prototype formulations using common processing techniques will lead to partnerships and licensing agreements with specialty chemical and pharmaceutical companies. The potential economic impact is expected to be improved efficiency of the drug development process in the next decade, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the area of drug development. The societal impact, long term, will be the availability of new and improved medicines that might otherwise have never been made available to the public because of their poor aqueous solubility.

Abstract: I/UCRC for Energy Harvesting Materials and Systems <br/><br/>1035042 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University; Daniel Inman <br/>1035024 University of Texas, Dallas; Bruce Gnade <br/><br/>The Center for Energy Harvesting Materials and Systems ((CEHMS) will focus on recovery (harvesting) of unused energy from various sources such as radio and television towers, satellites and various portable electronics. Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VT) and the University of Texas, Dallas (UTD) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with VT as the lead institution. <br/><br/>The proposal seeks a grant for a new multi-university Center for Energy Harvesting Materials and Systems to focus on energy harvesting approaches. The focus of research within this center will be to investigate a wide range of potential energy harvesting opportunities in power systems, human activity, industrial machines, vehicles, vibrating structures and other such sources. While the energy harvested in any one of the opportunities is small, the accumulation effect can be very significant. The proposed researchers have identified some unique and creative opportunities to assess the value and potential for harvesting energy that would otherwise be untapped. The research is important to the US and much of the world in efforts to capture new sources of energy. The reduction in dependence on foreign oil is always of significant value. The PIs have excellent credentials for conducting the research effort, and the involvement of a number of qualified researchers from the two collaborative universities is impressive. The proposal is very well written and the project descriptions are clear and well documented. The research tasks are appropriate and appear to be very well conceived. <br/><br/>The proposed Center has the potential to improve sustainability and profitability of US manufacturing firms by developing new technologies that will reduce energy consumption and harvest energy that is normally wasted. The proposal uses a diverse group of researchers to develop new technologies that can be used in developing new industries, new jobs, new products and new services in the future. The research team is made up of various ethnic and gender groups that have a variety of educational and professional experiences including minority and disadvantage groups. The technologies that are developed by this proposal have the potential to have a large economical impact by producing jobs in new industries and reducing the need for existing fossil fuels. The plan for involving underrepresented students and faculty in the center is very well presented and appropriate. The research program will enhance the already impressive infrastructure at the two universities. Because of the wide range of topics, the dissemination of the results will be primarily through publications and industry meeting. The students involved with the program will be well prepared to enter the workforce and provide additional technology transfer.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating fundamental research findings in Georeferenced Augmented Reality (AR) and Emulated Graphical Monitoring to develop a technology for estimating excavator proximity to invisible buried utilities in real-time while a machine is digging. AR is the superimposition of computer-generated images over a user-view of the real world. Emulated Graphical Monitoring is the concurrent 3D visualization of an engineering process ongoing in the real environment. The translated technology has the following unique features: it can allow excavator operators to persistently see what utilities are buried in a digging machine?s vicinity, thus helping prevent utility strike accidents; it can also allow the monitoring of a working excavator?s proximity to buried assets, thereby enabling real-time knowledge-based excavator control. These features provide exemplary situational awareness, safety, and confidence to excavator operators when compared to the leading competing machine control technologies in this market space that are limited to providing grade control guidance during excavation. The project accomplishes is goals by pursuing an accelerated plan to develop and evaluate a field-deployable prototype of the technology for customer demonstration and evaluation along the path to commercial reality, resulting in a market-ready capability that can allow an excavator operator to be visually aware of buried underground utilities and other assets in the vicinity of a machine, and can offer quantitative feedback of machine distance to vicinal obstructions. The partnership engages DTE Energy Company (Michigan?s largest electricity and gas provider), Miss Dig System (Michigan?s One-Call excavation safety agency), and member companies of the Michigan Infrastructure Transportation Association (MITA) to provide guidance in the excavation safety market space and other commercialization aspects as they pertain to the potential to translate the developed technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. <br/><br/>An excavator unintentionally hits a buried utility every 60 seconds in the U.S. causing fatalities, injuries, and property damage that annually cost billions of dollars. It is widely documented that these accidents occur either because excavator operators do not know where utilities are buried, or because they cannot perceive where the utilities are relative to the digging excavator. The potential economic impact of this project is expected to be the transformation of excavator operation from a skill-based activity to a knowledge-based practice, leading to improvements in productivity and safety within the next three years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the burgeoning civil infrastructure construction and rehabilitation industry. Such benefits will also accrue in manufacturing, transportation, mining, and ship-building where transition from skill-based to knowledge-based processes is seen to be of value. The societal impact, long term, will be the reductions in construction and underground infrastructure life-cycle costs that will be possible through safe and efficient excavation.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating smart multi-channel multi-dimensional micro-gas chromatography (MC-MD micro-GC) technology to fill portable and rapid vapor analysis gap. The translated smart MC-MD micro-GC has the following distinct advantages when compared with conventional 1-dimensional micro-GC or comprehensive 2-D micro-GC in the market or under development in labs. (1) It has unprecedented peak capacity and peak capacity efficiency while remaining portable, which arise from the long high-dimensional separation afforded by the smart GC design; (2) It can be scaled up to higher dimensional separation (such as 3-D or 4-D micro-GC) easily; (3) It does not require complicated thermal modulators widely used in comprehensive 2-D GC systems, thus substantially simplifying the GC design, fabrication, and power consumption; (4) Construction of the multi-dimensional (not only 2-D but also higher dimensional) chromatogram becomes straightforward by reading the retention time of each analyte directly from the vapor detector installed at the end of the each separation column; and (5) the detection limit is improved 3-10 fold, since the entire analyte is sent to the downstream column, rather than just a slice of it as in the conventional comprehensive 2-D GC. The project accomplishes this goal by prototyping a fully functional 1x2x4-channel smart 3-D micro-GC, which will include the following tasks: (1) assembly of all micro-GC components, (2) development of the corresponding operation/analysis algorithm, (3) performance evaluation using 100 vapor analytes, (4) assessment of market potential and commercialization feasibility, and (5) technical and entrepreneurial training of under/graduate students and post-doctors. The potential economic impact is expected to be a few billion US dollars in the next ten years which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in fields as diverse as agricultural and food industry, winery, environment monitoring/protection, healthcare, and homeland security/battlefield.<br/>Broader impact: Smart 3-D micro-GC has unprecedented peak capacity, easy operation, and simple 3-D chromatogram construction and thus will have a broad range of applications in environmental monitoring, homeland security, battlefield, industries, and healthcare. The students and the post-doctor will receive rigorous technical and entrepreneurial training and mentoring. Additionally, the team will work closely with the Master of Entrepreneurship Program at the University of Michigan to assess the market opportunities and viability of smart 3-D micro-GC. Dissemination of knowledge will include journal publications, conference presentations, patent filing, public seminars, and demonstration of the prototype at the science/technology exhibits in the Detroit area.

Abstract: Full Center Proposal (Phase II) for an I/UCRC for the Connection One Center for Radio Frequency Systems <br/><br/>1134641 Ohio State University (OSU); John Volakis <br/><br/>The Connection One site at the Ohio State University is proposing a Phase II support (second five-year period) for the Center, including support for central personnel, evaluation and research. The center is currently comprised of the Arizona State University (lead), the University of Arizona, the University of Hawaii, and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as research partners. <br/><br/>The objective of this Phase II Ohio State University proposal is to build on and continue its successful Phase I effort as part of the "Connection One: Communications Circuits and Systems Center" (C1 Center) already funded by the National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Program. The Ohio State University adds unique capabilities to the C1 Center for two reasons: (1) Has an established large program in Electromagnetics, RFICs and Radio Frequency Systems with over 120 graduate students and nearly 15 undergrads; (2) Extensive experimental facilities for antennas, RFICs, systems-on-a-chip testing and evaluation, polymer and ceramics fabrication, LTCC screen printing, terahertz imaging up to 3THz, and remote sensing. A recent State of Ohio $3M grant for terahertz equipment will be leveraged during Phase II as well. Ohio State will substantially increase the visibility and activity of the C1 NSF Center by focusing on measurements and system design activities (passive and active component integration for multifunctional all-in-one devices for high data rates). <br/><br/>The proposed site will focus on training students in a truly interdisciplinary arena for research in integrated communications systems, critical to many U.S. industries. The inherent aim of the Center is to integrate industry needs with University research and provide hands-on student experiences in a well-developed and supported laboratory setting for RFIC hardware, 4G wireless, coding and signal processing techniques, software radios/radars and MIMO technologies, RFIDs, new materials and metamaterials, sensors and sensor networks to mention a few. Collaborative projects with other universities within the C1 Center are another key aspect of the proposed site. The Ohio State University site has maintained from 7 to 10 industry and government members over the term of its phase I award, and has had success during its phase 1 award in the training of students through newly developed course work and the center's research.

Abstract: /UCRC for Wood-Based Composites Center <br/><br/>1035009 Virginia Polytechnic; Charles Frazier <br/>1034975 Oregon State University; Frederick Kamke <br/><br/>The Center for Wood-Based Composites will focus on advancing the material science of wood and wood-based composites. Virginia Polytechnic (VT) and Oregon State University (OSU) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with VT as the lead institution. <br/><br/>The proposed Center will advance the materials science of wood and wood-based composites, by improving the understanding of how wood interacts with adhesives, sealants, and composite manufacturing variables. The Center will promote research in building systems, mechanical and adhesive fastening between wood and non-wood materials, as well as novel material testing and modeling. The PIs also intend to further establish an internationally recognized research center that can help shape public policy, as related to timber management, reforestation, and the reduction of fossil fuel usage by using the advanced products. The two institutions involved in the proposed center have experience in working with industrial partners and conducting research projects. <br/><br/>The development of more advanced wood-based composites to be used in applications that currently depend primarily on steel, aluminum or concrete would have a positive impact on the environment and help combat climate change. The proposed Center plans to attract graduate and undergraduate students from a variety of disciplines, and to provide them with an opportunity to interact with industry leaders, thus giving them an understanding of how to apply and transfer fundamental research and impact the industry and the economy.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the research advances in computer vision technologies to fill the gap between research and the real needs in assistive technology for blind people. The goal of this project is to explore solutions for the challenges of designing wearable camera-based wayfinding assistants for blind persons from fundamental research to produce a portable proof-of-concept prototype to help blind users recognize targeted destinations from complex environments. The project accomplishes this goal by 1) developing robust motion deblurring methods to handle the irregular motions of blind users who are wearing the camera and 2) recognizing targeted destinations based on the requests of blind users for wayfinding and navigation. The proof-of-concept prototype system will be developed with visual information captured via a wearable camera on sunglasses/hat and a portable computer (mini laptop or cell phone) for data analysis, while the speech/sound outputs will be provided to a blind user via a Bluetooth earpiece. The performance of the newly developed algorithms and the proof-of-concept prototype will be evaluated by blind subjects.<br/>The partnership engages different areas of expertise including university research, industry real system design and development, and blind user study from organizations for the blind and visually handicapped to provide solutions for the most challenging problems (motion blur and query-based targeted destination recognition) in the design of wearable camera-based wayfinding and navigation aids for blind users. The interdisciplinary areas of expertise pertain to the potential to translate the computer vision based assistive technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. This will lead to new revolutionary design concepts of cost-effective and portable camera-based assistive devices to help visually impaired people in achieving functional mobility comparable to people with normal vision. The potential economic impact is expected to be $120 million in the next 10 years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in developing technology for blind wayfinding and navigation. This research has a direct impact to benefit the visually impaired, improve their inclusion and integration into society, and enhance their future employment opportunities, success in the workplace, independent living, and economic and social self-sufficiency.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating and developing a portable, high power, tunable semiconductor-based THz (terahertz) source. The technology is based on unique characteristics of high-power widely-tunable two-color laser in a novel two-chip vertical external-cavity surface-emitting laser (VECSEL). Access to the VECSELs' high-Q intracavity circulating power with orthogonal polarization provide highly efficient mean for type-II difference frequency generation (DFG) of THz radiation. Current THz sources suffer from low-efficiency, low output power in the range of tens of micro-Watts, limited operating temperature or large size and high cost. The intracavity THz generation in the two-chip cavity promises to overcome the limitations by providing high CW (continuous wave) power in the 10s of milli-Watts combined with mature and low-cost semiconductor technology, filling a major gap in THz technology. Targeted frequency in the 0.1 to 10 THz range will be achieved by accurately adjusting wavelength difference between the two chips in the 0.3-30 nm and selecting a suitable nonlinear crystal. The Air innovation partnership provides means to fabricate and demonstrate a high-power CW THz source in a compact prototype, transforming the future of THz technology. The business objective is to commercialize a compact, low-cost tunable THz source covering the broad THz spectrum. <br/><br/>The transformative impact of high-power THz source will be in various fields of science and technology including medical, pharmaceutical and manufacturing in the next decade. This will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in commercial and defense market. The commercialization of this novel laser technology will impact development of new tools in chemical and biological sensing with long term social and economic impact.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating advanced, compact ac-tuator technology, called Gear Bearing Drive (GBD) Technologies to fill a technology gap in the robotics and motion control industry that requires a new generation of actuators able to exhibit a number of desirable characteristics ranging from high power density and high efficiency, high positioning resolution, high torque capacity and torsional stiffness, lightweight designs and low-cost packages. The Gear Bearing Drive or GBD is a compact mechanism with two key abilities. It operates as an actuator providing torque and as a joint providing support. This is possible be-cause of the novel combination of external rotor (outrunner type) DC motor technology and Gear Bearing technology. The GBD is a bearingless powered joint with large power density. It utilizes a unique two stage planetary gear arrangement that allows a high reduction ratio while maintain-ing a compact form factor. The project accomplishes its goals by completing three specific ob-jectives: A) To fully analyze, characterize and experimentally test existing preliminary proof of concept prototypes of GBD; B) To develop and fully characterize experimentally advanced pro-totypes of GBD optimized using design for manufacturing approaches; C) To integrate a series elastic and torque sensing element with the GBD to facilitate human-machine interaction in GBD powered systems.<br/>In this project Northeastern University will be partnering with the start-up company Foodinie to investigate commercialization of the GBD. Foodinie, located in New York City, aims at de-veloping and commercializing novel robotic systems for assistance of the elderly at home. Food-inie is interested in developing both a novel robotic system actuated by the GBD and GBD actu-ated joint modules that could be sold as standalone components to other manufacturers. The PI and Northeastern University have recently been issued US patent 8,016,893 (Sep. 13, 2011) for this invention.<br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed project is the design, advanced prototyping and thor-ough testing of an innovative compact, advanced actuator assembly that could find immediate commercial application in important markets such as rehabilitation, medicine, aerospace and others. The GBD will considerably improve the torque density and mechanical efficiency of ac-tuated robotic joints, and enhance the portability and effectiveness of robotic systems engaged in biomechanical applications such as rehabilitation robots and wearable exoskeletons.<br/> The current market size for robotic devices is 12 billion dollar with an expected expansion to 25 billion over the next 5 years. This market includes established manufacturing, defense and aerospace industries and emerging medical/health markets in prosthetics, bionics, and rehabilita-tion robotics. The GBD has potential to permeate all of these markets to varying degrees. These market opportunities seem large and with the validation attained from this investigation, we ex-pect to be able to attract and secure venture capital support for commercialization of the GBD.<br/>The specific educational, broader impact and outreach activities of this project are: 1) The in-itiation of undergraduate students (including students from under-represented groups) in research in robotics; 2) The establishment of collaborative projects in advanced actuators and robotics with the science and technology high schools of Massachusetts with the objective to attract new students in this field; 3) The organization of a one semester I-cubator (student) project on market analysis and business planning for the proposed GBD technologies; 4) The establishment of a seminar series and of a webpage in the area of advanced actuators for robotic systems; and 5) The performance of graduate and undergraduate student internships in industry.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating smart fault detection methods for photovoltaic (PV) installations to fill the technology gap of identifying and protecting against dangerous electrical faults in solar PV installations. The translated science/technology has the following unique features: 1) it uses machine learning to identify fault type and fault location in the PV arrays; 2) it will be able to clear faults that traditional fuses or other fault protection devices cannot presently clear; 3) it will be a fully integrated fuse holder and box that has user interface allowing the user to monitor the PV array performance. The new solar PV protection technology will be able to isolate, clear, and identify the type and location of PV fault. This includes several types of faults that presently pose fire hazards to PV installations, such as line-to-line faults that may occur when branches or wires accidentally connect two different PV arrays in a big installation. The new, smart fuse protection adds exemplary safety, reliability, and even increased energy delivery when compared to the leading competing science/technology, such as traditional fuses or circuit breakers in this market space. <br/><br/>The project accomplishes this goal by running smart fault detection algorithms that utilize machine learning, nonlinear model prediction of PVs, intelligent measurements of PV currents and voltages, resulting in a method to identify hazardous fault location and types. Prototype smart over-current protection devices will be built with miniaturized self-contained electronics. The protection devices will be tested in PV installations to demonstrate their commercial viability and benefits.<br/><br/>The partnership engages Mersen USA Newburyport-LLC to provide guidance in the fuse/over-current protection manufacturing and commercial market. Mersen will help manufacture the prototype smart fuse holders and test them in their lab PV facilities. Throughout the project, Mersen will lead product testing, customer surveys and other aspects of commercialization and financing as they pertain to the potential to translate the smart PV fuse protection science/technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to be 1) the creation of a new product market in smart PV protection fuses projected to reach more than $750k annually within 2 to 3 years of the project conclusion and 2) the further acceptance of solar PV energy in the consumer marketplace by making the PV installations safer to the consumer. The smart PV protection devices will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this PV installation market, since each installation of solar PV array must utilize (usually multiple) over-current protection devices, such as fuses. The societal impact, long term, will be improved safety of any PV installation, increased energy yield due to immediate knowledge of fault, and better diagnosis in real-time of any reductions of energy yield caused by PV arrays that may need repair.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a novel biomanufacturing platform that uses plants for transient expression of therapeutic proteins to fill the need for rapid, inexpensive, and environmentally-friendly production of safe and effective human therapeutics. The translated plant-based biomanufacturing platform has the following unique features: harvested leaves from wild-type, nontransgenic Nicotiana benthamiana (a relative of tobacco) are used as production hosts, transient expression of the recombinant therapeutic protein takes place in a contained system, a novel Cucumber mosaic virus expression system is used to increase expression level, and glycosylation of the recombinant protein is modified in a post-production, in-vitro process providing an exemplary highly scalable approach that significantly reduces capital investment and manufacturing costs, minimizes environmental impact and improves product quality in terms of safety and consistency when compared to the leading competing production technologies in this market space. The project accomplishes this goal by developing a technoeconomic engineering-based model to quantify the capital investment costs and total production costs for a plant-based biomanufacturing facility to produce a human orphan drug, alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), evaluating the market potential and patent landscape surrounding our technology, identifying the regulatory pathway and refining our finance and revenue model to bring plant-made AAT closer to the market and position us to pursue partnerships for clinical development. Current partners include the UC Davis Engineering Translational Technology Center, an on-campus incubator that supports technology translation into venture to provide guidance in licensing, financing, incorporation and other aspects such as market assessment and freedom to operate analysis as they pertain to the potential to translate the plant-based biomanufacturing platform along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. Our current estimates indicate that the potential economic impact is expected to be hundreds of millions of dollars in healthcare savings over 5 years following commercialization. As applications are developed for other biosimilars/biobetters, the economic impact could grow into the billions of dollars per year with an attendant contribution to U.S. competitiveness in biotechnology. The societal impact, long term, will be much lower costs of human therapeutics and new, safer, reliable and expandable supply of biologics for treatment of diseases.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Research Alliance project focuses on building a sustainable innovation ecosystem in biophotonics, on educating the next generation of entrepreneurs and on accelerating the translation and transfer of key biomedical technologies developed by an NSF Science and Technology Center (STC), the Center for Biophotonics Science and Technology (CBST). <br/>The technologies proposed for commercialization in collaboration with our partners will fill technology gaps in the following areas: 1) super-resolution cellular imaging for biology and medicine, 2) novel non-photobleaching labels for imaging of cell dynamics, 3) monitoring cellular response to cancer drugs, and 4) automated blood pathology for disease detection and monitoring. These technologies have the following market-valued features: 1) outstanding image quality at resolutions that are at least 8 times higher (volume-wise) than the diffraction limit, that provide exemplary performance at lower, and thus more forgiving, illumination intensities when compared to leading optical microscopy technologies; 2) provide the ability to use non-photobleaching SERS (surface enhanced Raman scattering) labels for cellular imaging of cell dynamics, for monitoring unique biomarkers that cannot yet be monitored with other techniques; 3) capability to monitor cellular responses to cancer drugs in almost real-time by using Raman cytometry and in a more efficient manner compared with other experimental strategies; and 4) automated, real-time, point-of-care blood testing systems that provide enormous cost savings when compared to impedance-based, large, skilled labor-intensive and expensive commercially-available blood pathology systems. <br/>The Ecosystem for Biophotonics Innovation accomplishes this transfer to the market either by working in collaboration with research partners and transferring technologies to them, or via spinoffs, resulting in creation of new jobs (Entrepreneurial Fellows in academia, scientists collaborators in industry, and scientists in startup companies), commercial products for biology and medicine, with the potential to advance research and help patients while also training entrepreneurial scientists and generating licensing and royalty revenues. The partnerships engaged to transfer the technologies to the market domain include: 1) Applied Precision Inc, a GE Healthcare Company - will commercialize software algorithms for next generation super-resolution microscopes; 2) BD Biosciences - will commercialize novel SERS labels for studying cell dynamics; 3) Keaton Raphael Memorial foundation - will invest financial resources to advance technologies for diagnosis and treatment of pediatric cancers and to launch a startup company to commercialize the most promising technologies; 4) SARTA - will provide links to entrepreneurs in the region and educational opportunities; and 5) Tahoe Institute for Rural Health Research - will commercialize the automatic blood pathology system. <br/>The potential economic impact is expected to be realized through: 1) employing highly skilled and productive entrepreneurial fellows, faculty, as well as the scientists at our partnering organizations; 2) employing highly skilled scientists in spinoff companies; 3) licensing of technologies; and 4) through product sales (e.g., next generation super-resolution optical microscopes, labels and assays for cellular imaging, assays for monitoring cellular response to cancer drugs, and automated pathology systems), in the next one-to-five years. All these activities will ultimately contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the biomedical technology market space through ensuring that cutting-edge technologies are commercialized in the U.S. instead of by scientists and companies from other countries and through providing excellent professional development opportunities to talented entrepreneurial fellows who we expect will have innovative and resourceful careers beyond their tenure with EBI. In the short term, the societal impact includes the movement of advanced technologies closer to commercialization, as well as hands-on training and learning for the next generation of scientists and entrepreneurs regardless of whether entrepreneurial fellows pursue careers in academia or in the private sector. In the long term, the societal impact includes enhancement of scientific discovery enabled by cutting-edge instruments, medical devices, techniques and assays, better understanding of biophysical phenomena, and ultimately improved patient care. EBI will also benefit society by strengthening an infrastructure to promote innovation and to educate would-be entrepreneurs, while also enabling universities to more productively partner with private industry.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating an advanced network deduplication (dedup) technology for smartphones and tablets, called Smart-Cache, to fill the ever increasing need for better wireless network performance driven by the explosion in the number of wireless users.<br/><br/>The translated smart-cache solution consists of a suite of strategies to extend traditional dedup to mobile environments, and has the following unique features: (1) Asymmetric caching, which allows the dedup destination (dd-dst) to feedback to the dd-src the contents of its cache that otherwise might not be known to the dedup source (dd-src). (2) PreActing, that allows the dd-dst to opportunistically prefetch content when the latter is connected through a low-cost network access so that when such content is actually accessed through a high-cost network, the costs may be minimized. <br/><br/>The research contributions of these two variations lie in the underlying algorithms that are purpose-built to handle the unique challenges present in mobile environments. Preliminary trace-based performance analysis shows that smart-cache significantly improves the performance by reducing traffic consumption over cellular networks to the tune of 85% to 96%. Asymmetric caching by itself shows an improvement of 125% over symmetric caching.<br/><br/>The project accomplishes this goal by developing a viable prototype of the smart-cache solution so that an important credibility gap in the commercialization process for the technology may be addressed. While there are several avenues for productizing the smart-cache solution, we choose to build a prototype that could be adopted by both wireless network operators and third party solution providers. At a high level, we propose to build the following:<br/>- Smart-cache server: The project involves the building of a smart-cache server as a stand-alone network appliance that can be deployed within the wireless operators network or within a proxy environment of a third-party solutions provider. Building such an appliance allows for ready deployment in a target environment without concerns about the availability of computational resources. While the product form will be that of an appliance, the implementation will entirely be in software running on a Linux operating system. Hence, the prototype can easily be ported onto virtual machines in the target environment if necessary. <br/>- Smart-cache clients: The project involves the building of a smart-cache client for both Android and iOS devices. These two mobile platforms by far dominate the mobile device landscape today. While operating systems such as Windows Mobile and Blackberry RIM are other relevant platforms, solutions can later be developed or ported for these other platforms after the proposed prototyping effort is successfully accomplished.<br/><br/>The partnership engages the Georgia Tech VentureLab to provide guidance in wireless market dynamics and other aspects of commercialization and productization as they pertain to the potential to translate smart-cache along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.<br/><br/>The potential economic impact of smart-cache is profound, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in telecommunication industry. A wireless service provider could adopt smart-cache to immediately reduce the usage of expensive spectrum. Alternatively, a third party solutions provider could offer smart-cache as a cost and performance optimization service directly to the end-user. The project also makes the following broader impact contributions: (i) Industry: 85% of enterprise knowledge workers are expected to have smartphones within the next few years. The work on smart-cache will directly benefit the broad swathe of enterprises as better mobile access will improve employee productivity and customer engagement. (ii) Education: In addition we see the effort positively impacting both undergraduate and graduate level students through aggressive involvement of the students in both research and teaching.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation project from Iowa State University (ISU) will accelerate fundamental understanding in plant science and breeding with a screening platform that significantly reduces the time and costs for selecting and developing new elite plant varieties. The immediate goal is to build upon and re-engineer a promising near infrared (NIR)-based seed-screening platform to increase its performance and accuracy and broaden its applications. The envisioned platform is based on two complementary components: a) NIR molecular spectroscopy and chemometrics integrated with automated, nondestructive high-throughput screening of seeds and other plant materials, and b) customized development of application methodologies that screen extant plant populations based on biochemical phenotypes. This project seeks to meet the challenge presented by the success of high-throughput DNA sequencing and analysis of plant genomes, by establishing analogous high-throughput technologies to analyze a plant's biochemical phenotype. This capability will enhance the ability of plant scientists and plant breeders to utilize genomics and develop improved new cultivars needed to accommodate the global population explosion anticipated in the 21st century. The proposed phenotype-screening platform will have a significant impact on food, feed, and bio-energy production systems because, for the first time, plant scientists and breeders will have access to a unique research tool that will routinely assess, at low cost, multiple plant traits simultaneously and non-destructively based upon biochemical phenotypes. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are societal, economic, and learning related. At the societal level, plants have a remarkable, multi-faceted impact on economies, jobs, health, fuel, climate change/carbon sequestration, food security, world peace, the environment, and our overall well being. Better understanding of plant biology, improving existing varieties, and developing new ones are all key research areas where biochemical phenotype screening will produce invaluable data for achieving sustainable and nurturing ecosystems for a rapidly changing planet. At the economic level, these improvements will greatly enhance the versatility of the screening platform, expand the user base, and make lower cost screening accessible to more public and commercial plant scientists and breeders. At the learning level, the KEP participants will learn from each other. The project will be a vehicle for Iowa State University faculty and students and small businesses to understand how each other's abilities can be integrated to enable technological solutions to real world-challenges.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are Brownseed Genetics (Bay City, WI), Genetic Enterprises International (Johnston, IA), Kemin Industries (Des Moines, IA), MTEC BioAnalytics (Ames, IA), Schillinger Genetics (West Des Moines, IA), and Sustainable Oils (Bozeman, MT). Five ISU researchers and these six small businesses will collaborate in a Knowledge Enhancing Partnership (KEP). MTEC BioAnalytics will bring NIR seed screening technology expertise to the project while the other companies have expertise in seed and other plant based products. MTEC BioAnalytics will provide key highthroughput screening platform components (e.g., ultra fast fiber optic switch), engineering design, and the others will provide the use of proprietary and unique collections of characterized seeds that express variation in desirable biochemical phenotypes.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Research Alliance project focuses on the translation and transfer of situational intelligence and intelligent control technologies to fill real-time modern power system operation technology gaps. A utility-like control center will be developed at Clemson University to demonstrate these technologies and for rapid prototyping of real-time technologies for smart grid control centers. The technologies have the following market-valued features: scalability, systems-thinking approach, and grid intelligence that will increase real-time responsiveness to variable and uncertain generation, changing power loads and component failures, improve the dynamic and transient behavior of the power network, improve grid reliability, ensure local and wide area stability, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and assist human experts in control centers to respond quickly in a reliable and secure manner compared to the leading competing technologies in situational awareness and control center energy management systems (EMSs) in this market domain. <br/><br/>The project accomplishes this transfer to the market by developing situational intelligence systems and intelligent dynamic stochastic optimal power flow control for electric power control centers resulting in creation of new jobs in smart-grid analytics and modern power system operations, commercial products including intelligent EMSs for control centers, and intelligent decision-making and control tools with the potential to license, generate royalties, and sustain an innovation eco-system for developing leading-edge modern power system control center applications that will result in spinoffs. <br/><br/>The partnership engaged to transfer the technologies to the market domain include independent research laboratories and small businesses who will contribute to the development of the technology, control center platform vendors who will integrate the technology, and utilities that will test out the technology. The potential economic impact is expected to be in several millions of dollars in the next five years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the maximum penetration of variable and uncertain generation with enhanced control center operations capability. The societal impact, both short and long term, addresses national needs, especially for highly interconnected power system, in terms of sustainability, security, and reliability. Our nation's critical infrastructures depend on the electricity infrastructure to be reliable, secure and efficient. Situational intelligence and intelligent control for the electric power grid allows for: mitigation or even prevention of blackouts - billions of dollars saving in losses; high levels of renewable energy penetration; softening of negative effects of the climate change on the economy; minimization of impacts and rapid recovery from natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and malicious attacks.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Research Alliance project focuses on the translation and transfer of bone and soft tissue regeneration technologies to new products for musculoskeletal repair. Autograft and allograft based products are currently used for repair purposes and have several limitations including suboptimal strength, possible negative immune effects and risks of disease transmission. The new technologies and proposed products overcome the drawbacks posed by autografts and allografts. These new product technologies are potentially stronger, bioactive, more biocompatible and completely degradable while being ideally suited for load-bearing bone healing and soft tissue repair and regeneration applications. There are estimated to be over 1 million bone graft implants performed each year throughout the world. Production costs for the proposed technologies will be in the range of $500 per implant, yielding a $2000 net profit per implant. Our objective in the first 3 years is to achieve a 2% market share of bone grafts (20,000 grafts) which would provide $40 million in revenue per year. Every year, 400,000 rotator cuff repair procedures performed in the US require the use of a tendon augmentation device. Production costs are $1,000 per implant, yielding a $4000 profit per implant. We conservatively believe that 30% of repair operations would benefit from our soft tissue regeneration system (120,000 repairs) and that a 10% market share would be 12,000 repairs. This translates to a profit of 48 million per year. <br/><br/>In order to move these technologies to commercialization, we have categorized different products into short-term, mid-term and long-term time frames spanning 1 to 5 years. Short-term products include grafts fabricated from the materials alone without inclusion of any biologics. The short-term products, classified as devices or implants, create a short route to 510k FDA clearance (approval). An ample financial base from the aforementioned products will allow re-investment of R & D efforts toward the commercialization of subsequent products or to pursue an out-license or acquisition exit after subsequent 510k approvals. The strong patent portfolio and constant revenue from the initial product commercialization will create a self-sustainable academic centered innovation ecosystem. All these activities will ensure workforce development, create new jobs and businesses, and foster economic development. <br/><br/>Third party partnerships engaged to transfer the technologies to the market domain include technology niche analysis, business plan development, and initiation of new startup ventures for existing products and new products. The potential economic impact is expected to approximate 100 million per year in the next 2 to 3 years which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the orthopaedic device fixation, repair, and regeneration market.<br/><br/>Societal impact short term, the proposed devices successfully address issues and drawbacks related to biological grafts currently used and will improve treatment efficiency/cost, enhance patient compliance and contribute to a better quality of life. The developed products will be used as alternatives to current grafts. Identified material compositions and designs may find application in the delivery of growth factors, antibiotics and pain medications for treating a variety of musculoskeletal ailments in the long term. This proposed project has immense economic potential as well as a broad impact in education by bridging the interfaces of chemistry, biology, medicine and materials science.<br/><br/>Educationally, the proposed research will focus on the recruitment and training of underrepresented minorities at the undergraduate and graduate levels, thus ensuring a competitive and diverse dissemination of scientific knowledge. Students and fellows will be engaged in business plan development and encouraged to complete an internship with the third party investors to enhance their entrepreneurial skill sets.

Abstract: This NSF Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) project will translate and further develop a new generation of crosslinked aromatic polymer membranes for removing carbon dioxide from natural gas, separating oxygen (O2) and (N2) from air, and for hydrogen (H2) purification. The technology is based on the discovery that select examples of these membranes have unprecedented combinations of permeation, gas selectivity and resistance to performance degradation, particularly during separations of condensable gases such as carbon dioxide. Existing membranes are largely amorphous, glassy engineering thermoplastics that lack durability to organic contaminants in the gas streams. The AIR innovation provides a means to fabricate membranes into hollow fiber platforms in solution, but also the membranes can be post-modified to develop both the needed durability as well as very good transport and mechanical properties.<br/><br/>The economical separation of air into O2 and N2 will enable inert N2 atmospheres to transport food globally and also will be applied to aircraft fuel tanks to minimize fires/explosions. Economical generation of purified H2 will play a critical role in developing a hydrogen economy for fuel cell systems for transportation, stationary (home) power, and portable electronics.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation project focuses on thermal-modification technology to enhance the utility of engineered wood products in order to improve dimensional stability and resistance to biodegradation and weathering. Service life will also be extended, while at the same time reducing environmental impacts. This project will advance thermal-modification technology toward the development of advanced, high-performing engineered wood products. Thermally-modified wood is currently used in a limited set of applications, including solid wood flooring, external cladding, and decking products. This project will advance the platform so that it can be the basis of new, high-volume, and in-demand engineered wood products for markets that are poised to grow quickly in the near future when the demand for engineered wood products increases with the rebound in U.S. residential and commercial construction. The completion and validation of research will also facilitate interactions and information exchange between stakeholders within the forest products industry to enhance opportunities for sustained forest products production and use; and it will contribut to improvement in the knowledge, skills, and capacity of the forest products industry workforce and management. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project will be job creation, national export earnings, and better homes and buildings from engineered wood products. This project will advance the scientific understanding of the thermal-modification platform and propel it toward potential applications for new, ultra-high-performing thermally-modified engineered wood products that excel in severe environmental conditions. Ultimately, such products will bolster the critical U.S. forest products industry by increasing U.S. economic competitiveness, increasing the number of jobs (many of them in rural and lesser-populated areas where the need is particularly great), increasing revenues for manufacturers, and accelerating the export of new products.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are the Knowledge-Enhancement Partners: University of Minnesota Duluth Natural Resources Research Institute (Duluth, MN); Small businesses: Aspen Research Corporation (Maple Grove, MN); C.S.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating basic research in glycoscience to fill a technology gap in the field of rapid detection kits for infectious agents. The translated science has the following unique features: The small molecules are sensitive, selective, and robust, easy to produce in large quantities with no lot-to-lot variation, easy conjugation to different sensor surfaces, can be used directly as recognition molecules in bio-sensing applications or can be used in combination with existing technologies. These features provide rapid test kits that will have extended shelf life without the requirement of refrigeration and therefore can be used in a variety of settings including low resource areas, can be used by untrained personnel, and are inexpensive when compared to the leading competing antibody or nucleic acid based technology in this market space. The project accomplishes its objectives by developing and integrating glycoconjugates in a rapid diagnostic test resulting in a proof-of-concept prototype for select infectious agents. The partnership engages industrial partners to provide guidance in the biosensor marketplace as the partners are actively involved in the research and development of rapid diagnostics and other development aspects such as optimization, testing, product positioning, etc. as they pertain to the potential to translate the science/technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. <br/><br/>The potential economic impact of this project is expected to be very significant in the next five to six years as the market for point of care diagnostics is estimated to be over twenty billion dollars. This novel technology can overcome some of the problems associated with current rapid test kits, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this market space. The societal impact, long term, will be decreased morbidity and mortality as early diagnosis is key to selecting appropriate countermeasures to control and minimize the impact of harmful toxins and pathogens.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the science and technology of unique multifunctional ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) film (coating) technology into superior energy storage cells and solutions that fill the performance, life-cycle, and production readiness gap evident in conventional battery applications. The collective goal is to produce a commercially viable path to the next generation of Li-ion batteries (LIB) and a new generation of thermal Li-Sulfur (TLS) batteries. The translated science and technology of UNCD-based LIB and TLS have the following unique features: i) high performance anodes based on electrically conductive UNCD-coated metal anodes to increase the battery lifetime by at least 10x with respect to current technologies, ii) UNCD-based membranes for Li+ ions transport with at least 10x higher resistance to battery environmental and chemical attacks than for current batteries, and iii) UNCD films as extremely chemically resistant coatings for the battery inner walls case to substantially lower the cost, extend cells' life-cycle, and improve the economic viability of the end product. Currently, much more expensive metals would be required to survive the targeted x10 longer life time (given exposure to the harsh environment of the LIB and TLS batteries). This PFI AIR project intends to deliver a TLS battery that has a potential volumetric energy density of 2,600 Wh/l with a theoretical specific energy density of 2,500 Wh/kg, which is at least x10 superior performance to current battery technologies. The state-of-the-art for cathodes and anodes (two critical components) for this couple currently features a theoretical volumetric energy density of 2,125 Wh/l and a theoretical specific energy density of 597 Wh/kg. The resulting TLS approach will provide 22% improvement in volumetric energy density and ~400% improvement in specific energy density over existing secondary LIB technologies, when compared to the leading competing LIB science/technology from manufacturers in this market space. <br/>The project accomplishes its objectives by developing: i) boron-doped UNCD (B-UNCD) and nitrogen-grain boundary incorporated (N-UNCD) coated metallic electrodes (e.g, tungsten (W), titanium (Ti), or W-coated Cu) to determine which is the best anode material to insert in the new generation of LIB and TLS batteries, ii) the best approach between a patented chemical etching processes from Advanced Diamond Technologies (ADT) and UNCD-coated Si-based or anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes used as templates to produce 10x more chemically robust UNCD-based membranes than current battery membranes, and iii) chemically resistant UNCD coating for the inner walls of the battery metal case to make it possible to use a less expensive metal material as opposed to currently used molybdenum that is both expensive and chemically less resistant. A prototype coin-type battery will be demonstrated as a proof-of-concept of the novel UNCD-based LIB and TLS battery technologies for defibrillators/pacemakers, cell phones, and computers. The new UNCD-based battery technology will be scalable to produce larger batteries for larger systems such as car batteries. <br/>The partnership engages researchers from the University of Texas at Dallas (Materials Science and Engineering Department), who will provide N-UNCD coatings for the battery anodes and UNCD-coated membranes based on the Si and AAO templates. The industrial and commercialization partner is Advanced Diamond Technologies (ADT), a company currently expanding the commercial application of thin smooth diamond. ADT will provide the expertise for developing the B-UNCD films as alternative electrically conductive coatings for battery anodes, as described above. In addition, ADT will provide expertise on customer identification, engagement and commercialization, as well as manage production of the diamond coated battery components (pre-integration) and public introduction of the first LIB/TLS batteries in the market. The infrastructure is already in place in ADT facilities to translate the UNCD coating science/technology along a path that will result in a competitive commercial reality for a new generation of LIB and TLS batteries with potentially 10x better performance than current batteries. <br/>The potential economic impact includes domestic production of high energy density cells expected to become viable in the next five years, and will re-engage the US as a competitive fixture in the batteries market space with key, targeted market segments in medical devices/systems, mobile communication devices, computers and many other systems requiring long life low cost batteries. The societal impact, long term, will be in the form of i) at least 10x smaller/longer life for medical implants (i.e., defibrillators/pacemakers), which will impact positively the quality of life of people requiring these devices, and ii) longer life/smaller batteries to power more efficient cell phones, portable computers, and other electronic devices.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating previously developed fundamental science to coat orthopedic implants made out of polymers with bioactive coatings. With the increasing clinical acceptance of Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implants, there is an urgent need in the industry to develop low-temperature coating processes. The translated biomimetic coating technology has several distinctive features. First, being a low temperature benign process, it is eminently suitable for coating polymeric substrates such as PEEK implants. Second, the process has the ability to produce carbonated-calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA), similar in composition to bone mineral and a bioactive variation of inert hydroxyapatite. Third, unlike conventional biomimetic processes spanning over several weeks, the deposition of the coating takes place within a relatively short time frame of less than an hour, thus providing the ability for large scale industrial production. All of these features taken together make the technology more versatile than conventional coating processes. This project accomplishes the broad objective of fabricating the coatings and evaluating them for their physical, mechanical, and biomedical properties in vitro and in vivo; data essential to obtain approval from the various regulatory agencies, like the FDA. <br/><br/>This effort is a "Win-Win" situation for both the partners: The University of Toledo and Orchid Bio-coat (Orchid) will work with the University of Toledo's Technology Transfer Office to bring the technology to market. The partnership engages Orchid to provide guidance to UT in the overall manufacturing, translation, distribution and further commercialization aspects that will introduce to the market a new generation of bioactive orthopedic implants made out of PEEK. Orchid is one of the nation's largest providers of plasma sprayed coatings on titanium implants with their distribution network all across the globe. However, with the switch from metallic to polymeric implants, UT will be able to provide the "turn-key" technology. The potential economic impact is expected to be felt within next three years' time frame, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this orthopedic implant space.<br/><br/>This project has a significant societal impact on the ageing "Baby Boomers" and an increasingly active general population. These segments of the society, which are growing at a very fast rate, experience the most musculoskeletal diseases and injuries. This population is expected to require a wide variety of implants. In the U.S., the orthopedic reconstructive device/implant market is presently experiencing an annual growth rate of 12 to 14%, which is even higher than that of the spinal implant market, growing at 10%. This proposal will address this demand by developing improved and novel products with enhanced integration of the implant with the adjoining boney surfaces. The effort will also train qualified manpower and will cater to the needs of implant manufacturers.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the synergistic combination of low heat rejection (LHR) and low temperature combustion (LTC) to fill the technological gap between existing commercially available internal combustion engines and the clean high-efficiency advanced combustion engine. The translated LHR/LTC technology has the following unique feature: low heat rejection from a low temperature combustion engine that results in more favorable thermodynamics compared to either conventional or ordinary low temperature combustion engines. This provides exemplary efficiency, engine-out exhaust emissions of nitrogen oxides and fixed carbon, and suitable exhaust temperatures for favorable operation of exhaust emission control systems when compared to the leading competing internal combustion engine. The project accomplishes its objectives by performing a proof-of-concept that experimentally and computationally realizes LHR concepts with LTC in a compression ignition engine resulting in a prototype LHR/LTC combustion mode operating in a light-duty automotive diesel engine. The partnership engages General Motors, which engineers and manufacturers the prototype-intended light-duty automotive engine. GM provides guidance in the global automotive market space such as operating constraints, cost limitations, and technology integration with a marketable product in order to translate LHR/LTC combustion along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to be nearly $40million in the next 10 years (based on new diesel vehicle registrations in the United States demonstrating on average $256/year in fuel cost savings at $4.00/gallon fuel cost), which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this automotive market space. The societal impact, long term, will be improved vehicle fuel economy with reduced emission of criteria pollutants (e.g., nitrogen oxides), thereby reducing vehicle carbon footprint. Additionally, this effort will augment the investigators? efforts to increase female and underrepresented students in STEM disciplines and improve undergraduate student course instruction in thermodynamics by leveraging resources used for summer STEM camps and course redesign activities. Finally, scholarly articles and conference presentations will be disseminated to ensure scientific and technological pathway discoveries are made known.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a fundamental recycling technology to address gaps in the existing Li-ion battery recycling processes. The translated recycling technology demonstrates lower cost and higher efficiency when compared to existing hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical recycling techniques in this market space. The project accomplishes its objectives by recovering cathode materials from spent Li-ion batteries and producing new cathode materials regardless of the Li-ion battery cathode chemistry. In addition, the project will recover copper current collectors using a sensor-based sorting technology that, combined with the proposed hydrometallurgical recovery process, will result in a closed-loop industrial recycling process for Li-ion batteries with varying chemistries. The partnership engages wTe Corporation to provide guidance in sensing technologies to extract copper-bearing materials. wTe will also assist with addressing marketing, financing, and commercialization issues in order to translate the proposed Li-ion battery recycling process to a competitive commercial reality. <br/><br/>With increasing consumer demand for hybrid cars, electrical cars, portable electronics, and grid systems, the usage of Li-ion batteries is increasing and is only projected to rise in the future. Since the largest Li reserves exist in politically unstable or uncooperative countries, demand for these critical resources are a matter of national strategic importance. Additionally, from an environmental perspective, the electrolyte in Li-ion batteries is flammable. If Li-ion batteries are burned, toxic HF could be released into the environment. Existing recycling techiques aimed at Li-ion batteries are either cost-prohibitive or unable to accommodate the ever-changing Li-ion battery chemistries. Employing a combination of improved Li-ion extractive metallurgy and sensor-based sorting technologies, the proposed collaboration between WPI and wTe will enable the development and commercialization of a novel recycling process that will address these limitations, the growing demand for critical materials, help mitigate environmental risks, and secure strategic national interests.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating innovative surface modification science with fluid-bed coating technology for producing fine drug nano-composite particles to fill current technology gap of lack of scalable and economically feasible methods to produce highly bioavailable drug composite particles that do not have a gritty mouth-feel, which is undesirable for patients with swallowing disorders. The translated science-based technology has the following unique features: very fast dissolution even for poorly water soluble drugs, a size small enough for incorporation into orally disintegrating dosages, and excellent flow and handing properties that provide exemplary performance using conventional robust processing methods that lead to efficient, scalable and cost-effective manufacturing when compared to the leading competing technologies such as spray drying and hot-melt extrusion for bioavailability enhancement, or freeze-dried fast disintegrating dosage forms in this market space. <br/><br/>The project accomplishes this goal by combining fundamental aspects of surface science to reduce cohesion of carrier particles and to stabilize nano-drug particles, which are 300 times smaller than the diameter of human hair, to preserve their large surface area resulting in a proof-of-concept highly bioavailable drug composite particle that is taste-masked, and is less than 50 microns, i.e., smaller than the diameter of human hair. <br/><br/>The partnership engages Catalent Pharma Solutions, a contract manufacturer, along with their pharmaceutical company clients to provide guidance in the technological as well as regulatory aspects of orally disintegrating dosage forms and other aspects such as patentability, market research, financing, and commercialization as they pertain to the potential to translate the science based technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The final output of the commercialization is a robust manufacturing platform that is applicable to any poorly water soluble drug and forming fast dissolving drug-composite small particles that can be used in chewable tablets, syrups, strip-films or lozenges, targeting patients having swallowing disorders, thus increasing patient compliance. As a reference, the majority of newly discovered drugs are almost insoluble in water; while the market for dysphagia alone is currently over $3B/year. <br/><br/>The potential economic impact is expected to be well over $100M/year in the next five to fifteen years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the pharmaceutical sector, since nanostructured particulates are produced via methods that have scalability, reproducibility, low cost, and high-yield, and the products will have better bioavailability, are smaller and are essential components of next generation pharmaceutical manufacturing. Similarly, it can have an impact on other industries; such as; food, agrochemical, nutrient delivery, cosmetics, as well as dental and bio-materials. The societal impact, long term, will be in robust manufacturing platform that leads to products that provide improved patient comfort, hence compliance, and improved performance using simple, cost-effective processes, as well as have the reduced-risk of using nano-particles through lack of associated exposure to factory workers.

Abstract: This AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating manycore compiler technology to fill the designer productivity and manycore usage efficiency gap.<br/><br/>There is a wide consensus among computer architects that existing multicore processor designs do not scale due to the complexity of memory hierarchy. As a result memory hierarchies in manycore architectures are expected to be simpler ? with the onus of memory management now in software. However, doing that is extremely complicated for the programmer. The proposed manycore compiler technology alleviates this programmer difficulty. It automatically inserts data management instructions in the application and enables their efficient execution on manycore processors.<br/><br/>The translated technology has the following unique features: push-button compilation and automatic yet efficient data management that provides exemplary improvements in software development time and cost for near future manycore processors. In addition, it will also result in improved performance, and lower power consumption of the application executing on the manycore processor.<br/><br/>The project accomplishes this goal by developing a LLVM based compiler that will analyze the application and insert data management instructions in the program, so that the applications execute correctly and efficiently, resulting in a prototype compiler that will enable the execution of existing applications on manycore processors. While there are compiler techniques that solve a part of the problem, but our compiler not only outperforms them [see the results in our recent publications], but provides a holistic solution to the manycore programming challenge.<br/><br/>The partnership engages Intel (a manycore processor development company) and Raytheon Missile Systems (a manycore software development company) to provide guidance in the manycore processor and software marketplace and other aspects, including financing and commercialization as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.<br/><br/>The potential economic impact of our manycore compiler technology is expected to be very significant, as this compiler technology will be needed by companies that want to use manycore processing for high performance and low power. For example, 3D tomography, high capacity 3D printers, ultra high definition 3D TVs, automatic target recognition and collision avoidance at supersonic speeds, etc., all need highest levels of performance, under strict power constraints. The power and performance needs of these applications can only be met by manycore processors, but manycore processors are not expected to have the support for memory management in hardware. Therefore existing applications will not execute on them. Our compiler will enable the execution of these applications, and therefore utilize the power and performance of latest manycore processors. This edge can greatly contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in information technology, defense systems, and consumer electronic market space.<br/><br/>The societal impact, in the long term, will be that the end user will receive high performance, yet power-efficient computing products at reasonable costs. This improves affordability of computing products that we need for everyday living, defense, services, healthcare etc., and elevates standard of living, especially for the economically disadvantaged.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating basic studies of ion energy distribution control in low temperature plasmas to fill a gap in the ability of the semiconductor industry to meet future needs in the manufacturing of silicon integrated circuits with higher circuit density. The translated method for ion energy distribution control in plasma processing has the unique feature of single, selectable energy ion bombardment, that, combined with a self-limiting charge neutralization step, provides exemplary performance advantages in patterning insulating and conducting layers in silicon integrated circuit fabrication, including higher selectivities in etching one material relative to another, and in dimension control leading to improved yields, when compared to the leading competing technology of radio frequency bias in this market space. In addition, the simplicity and efficiency of power delivery, compared to the competing tailored waveform bias gives it an additional advantage. The project accomplishes this goal by using pulsed DC bias to an electrode and the substrate stage to obtain energetic ion bombardment, then electron flux to neutralize charge, resulting in a mono-energetic ion flux with no charge-up issues on insulating materials. The project will produce a prototype that will consist of a substrate stage and a boundary electrode that can be immersed in a pulsed plasma. Positive DC voltage on the boundary electrode during the afterglow produces energetic ion bombardment, while positive DC spikes to the substrate stage temporarily bringing the surface to near plasma potential, allowing electron flow to neutralize positive surface charge. The project will deliver a proof-of-concept, the specifications for this hardware, and a path to scale-up. The partnership engages Tokyo Electron America and GlobalFoundaries to provide guidance in the semiconductor plasma etching market space and other aspects, including supplying test samples that would increase credibility in the market space, and potential future investments that could accelerate the translation of this technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating an Additive Manufacturing technology called Selective Inhibition Sintering (SIS) to fill the gap for an inexpensive and capable 3D Printer for fabrication of metallic parts. Currently all metallic part printers are highly priced and are unaffordable by small manufacturing firms as well as by the growing maker community which is increasingly becoming the source of much innovation in the U.S.<br/>The translated technology has the following unique features: a) It will be an order of magnitude less expensive than current metallic part printers, b) it can process very high temperature metals and alloys such as super alloys which have extensive uses, and c) it can build a large number of parts concurrently hence is suitable for small to medium lot size manufacturing. The technology provides exemplary cost effectiveness and high throughput when compared to the leading competing technologies (such as DMLS, EBM, and LENS) in this market space. <br/>The project accomplishes this goal by a systematic research, development and experimentation process resulting in a reliable process knowledge and a pre-production machine that can be mass produced at low cost and will be able to print precise parts out of a variety of metals and alloys. <br/>The partnership engages RapidTech, ASCO Sintering, ProMetal and 3D Systems to provide guidance in the technical aspects of metallic AM domain and other aspects of commercial relevance as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to be over $30M in two years after the commercial introduction of the technology and much more in the succeeding years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the rapidly growing metallic Additive Manufacturing market space. <br/>The societal impact, long term, will be paramount as the proposed project will yield an affordable machine that will be capable of rapidly fabricating parts out of bronze, stainless steel, and titanium as well as other metal powders generally used in powder metallurgy. Practical uses of such a technique includes fabrication of functional parts for the aerospace and automotive industries, and custom design parts for medical devices, primarily using hard-to-machine materials such as stainless steel, titanium and super alloys. The SIS process will be particularly useful for the conventional powder metallurgy industry because it can eliminate the need for fabrication of expensive molds. Finally, metallic 3D Printing has so far been out of the reach of the growing maker community. SIS has the promise of making the needed capability available to this creative community which is already making significant economic and social impact in the US.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a novel technology for non-optical measurement of local tissue biomechanics to fill a key unmet need for real time soft tissue health diagnostic technologies. The translated dual-mode diagnostic probe has the following unique features: 1) It combines both biomechanical and impedance measurement in the same device, which likely enhances sensitivity and specificity; 2) It's detection zone can be designed down to 2 mm in diameter, enabling a minimally invasive profile and fine local analysis; 3) It interrogates tissue through a width and depth equivalent to twice its diameter, enabling identification of deeper tissue phenomena with less invasion; 4) it is real-time, alleviating more costly and time consuming follow-on analysis and permitting instantaneous decision making for the user without risk of losing the location; 5) it can be manufactured very cheaply using flexible electronics. These features will provide improved diagnostic performance over current approaches that utilize only one-mode of sensation in this market space (e.g. Dune Biomedical), and significant time and cost savings compared to traditional excisional tissue biopsies. Furthermore, this technology will enable interrogation without tissue destruction, which is of paramount importance for very sensitive tissue regions (e.g. glands, nerves, lymph nodes) in this market space. The project accomplishes this goal by optimizing the probe geometry, electrical stimulation profiles, and pressure ranges that safely quantify biomechanical and impedance measurement in soft tissues. These results will generate a field serviceable prototype that will establish the foundation for evaluation in potential markets and commercialization. <br/><br/>This proposal will engage the Cornell Center for Technology Commercialization, Cornell biotechnology Institute and partner with the McGovern Business Incubator to provide business development and scale-up guidance, access to financial networks, and connection to future industrial partners that are experienced in navigating the diverse regulatory and manufacturing landscapes as they pertain to the potential to translate the dual-mode along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. When successful, the potential economic impact is expected to be widespread, filling needs in markets ranging from food science to cancer margin detection. The first market area of pre-term labor will be focused on in this proposal, and it is anticipated that clinical trials in humans can be initiated within the next 5 years. When successful, this low-cost, quantitative, real-time assessment tool will enhance U.S. competitiveness in medical diagnostic technologies. Societally, access to real-time quantitative diagnostics, especially bringing that technology closer, potentially in the hands of the end-user, provides significant cost and time savings, leading to a better quality of life.

The partnership engages Tennessee Technological University (TTU), the University of Akron (UA) and technology consultant Mr. Hugh Cameron to provide guidance in the concrete construction materials industry and other aspects related to market development, licensing, business planning and financing as they pertain to the potential to translate the new technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to be a reasonable market share of the existing shrinkage reducing admixture sales in the next five years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the concrete admixture market space. The societal impact, long term, will be to improve the performance of concrete infrastructure and thereby save potentially billions of future dollars in lost time and energy consumption due to avoided early and premature repair and maintenance.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Research Alliance project focuses on the translation and transfer of programmable, nano-enabled chemical sensor technologies to fill technology gaps in medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring. The technologies have the following market-valued features: programmable ligand sensitivity, miniature form factor, and compatibility with lab-on-a-chip technology, that provide exemplary sensitivity, selectivity, and overall performance when compared to the leading competing technologies in this market domain, for example ELISA tests and metal oxide gas sensors. The project accomplishes this transfer to the market by developing a set of platform technologies suitable for incorporation into commercial products across a broad set of applications, resulting in creation of new jobs in sensor systems design and manufacturing, commercial products for analysis of disease biomarkers and air/water quality, with the potential to license intellectual property generated by the project that will result in spinoffs.<br/><br/>The partners engaged to transfer the technologies to the market domain include major industry (Intel, Lockheed Martin), start up ventures (Adamant Technologies, Graphene Frontiers), and a technology-based economic development program (Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Southeastern Pennsylvania) with a network of angel investors. The partners will provide crucial insight into potential markets and application spaces, as well as access to critical technical capabilities and capital that will enable the new ventures that emerge to flourish. <br/><br/>The potential economic impact is expected to be on the scale of tens to hundreds of millions of dollars in the next five to ten years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this global chemical sensors market. The societal impact in the short term will be the creation of technologies that will drive a transformation to a "smart society" where integrated chemical sensor systems are ubiquitous. The longer term impacts include a new generation of science and engineering students, educated in depth in their discipline but also with experience in the agile, dynamic thinking processes that are characteristic of innovative, entrepreneurial small businesses.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating science and technology in nanoscale optical antenna to fill the gap for Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR). The translated science and technology in nanoscale optical antenna has the following unique features: the nanoscale optical antenna focuses light into nanoscale size with high efficiency, and moreover, can be manufactured using industrial standard technology for mass production. HAMR has been identified as the next generation data storage technology. The key component in HAMR is a near field transducer (NFT) for producing a light spot of tens of nanometers in size for localized heating. The proposed nanoscale optical antenna is an ideal candidate for being used as the NFT to provide high efficiency and a small light spot when compared to the other NFT designs. <br/><br/>The project accomplishes this goal by proof-of concept design and analysis, prototype development, and demonstration of a fully functional NFT. Our partnership engages Advanced Storage Technology Consortium (ASTC), the consortium of the data storage companies, to provide guidance in the prototype development and commercialization as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to affect the next generation hard disk drives which currently have a market of 600 million units per year, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the data storage industry. <br/><br/>The societal impact, long term, will be on science and engineering and human resource development. The outcome of this project will have direct impact on the development of the next generation data storage technology. The project will also advance the relevant science and engineering. The ability to concentrate light into a nanoscale spot with high efficiency has significant impact not only on the HAMR technology development but also many other areas, from biological/chemical sensing to nano-photonics devices. Results of fundamental research will be broadly disseminated by journal publications, conference presentations, and websites, including Purdue's nanoHUB web portal. The proposed research will also contribute to human resource development, including providing graduate and undergraduate students with trainings in interdisciplinary areas and experience in technology transfer, integrating research outcomes with curriculum, outreaching to high school students, and recruiting and educating students from under-represented groups.

Abstract: This NSF Accelerating Innovation Research (AIR) project will create an innovation ecosystem between/among public-private partners to provide weather warning systems, technologies, and processes. Assessing the guidelines for optimal scale of rainfall-runoff and employing high resolution analyses of the current state of the atmosphere will enable pinpointing areas where storm development will occur. Additionally, social science methods will evaluate human response to flood warnings with recommended warning strategies. <br/><br/>Weather has significant societal impacts. 3.4% or $485 billion of the 2008 U.S. gross domestic product is sensitive to weather variability, and the extreme weather of 2011 resulted in at least 922 deaths and more than $70 billion in total economic losses. This will be one of the first deployments of X-band radars for flood warning in the U.S. These activities will result in the creation of new knowledge in the fields of flash flood warning, storm initiation, and urban-scale decision-making.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation project from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) focuses on innovation in the area of fast-acquisition-speed spectrally resolved two-photon microscopy (SR-TPM) and identification of biomarkers and labeled antibodies for use in research, diagnostics, and drug screening applications. As part of the PFI project, an Open Forum for Innovation (OFI) will be established to develop and guide proof-of-concept experiments in several areas related to SR-TPM technology development and applications: (1) high-spectral resolution and high-acquisition speed imaging scanners, (2) fiber laser alternatives to current solid-state lasers, and (3) novel biomarkers and labeled antibodies for detecting transient interactions between proteins in vivo, identifying rare cell types (such as circulating cancer cells) in body fluids, and developing living cell assays for cell signaling pathways to be used for drug screening. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are (1) expansion of the SR-TPM customer base, currently represented by cellular biologists, to include both biochemists and drug researchers; (2) introduction of fiber laser products more broadly to the microscopy market; and (3) expansion of applications of fast-acquisition speed spectrally resolved fluorescence microscopy to include development of targeted diagnostics and therapeutics. This team's ability to address such needs would significantly expand the U.S. presence in the scanning fluorescent microscope market, by providing product capabilities that exceed those of existing products. Proof-of-concept experiments to be conducted will directly involve graduate, undergraduate students, and postdoctoral researchers who will work alongside consultants and lab scientists from the<br/>knowledge-enhancement partner companies. To add to the university's innovation capacity and create a cadre of UWM-grown scientist-entrepreneurs during the performance period of this project, OFI will evolve into a UWM University-Small Businesses Collaboratory (UWM-USBC), which will offer resources and networking opportunities to its member investigators, establish a gateway for businesses to UWM-developed technology, and promote the PFI project leaders as role models for knowledge transfer within UWM, in the Southeast Wisconsin area, and in the U.S.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project include the Knowledge Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of UWM (College of Letters and Science (through its Department of Physics) and the Graduate School at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee), and three small businesses: Aurora Spectral Technologies, LLC (Milwaukee, WI), NeoClone Biotechnology International, LLC (Madison, WI), and PolarOnyx, Inc.

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating high performance mathematical models of bioheat transfer for reliably and accurately predicting and visualizing the outcome of laser induced thermal therapy. Minimally-invasive laser ablation is a medical procedure that provides a means of rapidly delivering heat to target diseased tissue in the body and will be used in this project to kill focal cancerous lesions in brain as well as diseased neurological tissue, such as epilepsy. The translated computing technology has the following unique features: (1) the predictive capabilities of the prototype device will assist in minimizing the surgical impact on the patient and (2) the prototype device will be tightly coupled to existing FDA approved procedures in humans and rigorously validated to assure accurate predictions. This provides exemplary improvement in the efficacy of the procedure as no comparable technology currently exists and the neurosurgeon does not have the capability to a-priori visualize outcomes for complex treatment scenarios (multiple lasers/trajectories) near essential anatomical structures. <br/><br/>The project accomplishes this goal by utilizing hybrid multi-core and GPU computing architectures combined with sophisticated mathematical algorithms resulting in a portable, aggressively parallel, medical image driven prototype simulation device. The partnership engages industry (BioTex Inc.) and academic centers (Rice University and MD Anderson) to provide guidance in this minimally invasive neurosurgical market space as well as to commercialize and validate the technology as they pertain to the potential to translate the high performance computing technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to improve treatment effectiveness within the yearly greater than 200,000 brain tumor cases and greater than 1 million epilepsy cases in the U.S. Within a 5-yr timeframe, this will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this minimally invasive neurosurgical market space. The societal impact, long term, will provide novel computational and mathematical tools for improving the safety and efficacy of computer assisted image guided therapy for this important medical application.

Abstract: This proposal aims to translate a unique Si nanoelectronic biosensor technology well developed at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) towards commercial products through a strong academia-industry partnership. The proposed work will develop a prototype instrument called FemtoSensor (femtoMolar sensitivity) Application Development Kit (ADK) based on a nanoscale Si on insulator (SOI) field effect transistor (FET) and to establish proof-of-concept protein-based tests towards a portable and low-cost diagnostic platform capable of label-free, rapid and early diagnostics of various diseases. The novel design of multiple Si nanochannel architecture brings critical advantages over previous bio-FETs, e.g. simultaneously achieving high sensitivity (femtoMolar), selectivity, and stability, as demonstrated by repeated tests in serum and tumor-cell lysate sample without pre-purification. <br/><br/>The full exploitation of the multi-nanochannel bio-FETs will contribute novel knowledge to the field of biosensor. The parametric evaluation of the sensor will address major unknowns of biosensing mechanism where strong electric field is applied, which is highly transformative to many types of sensors using electrokinetics. The proposed study will establish a numerical model of the performance curves to possibly predict sensing results, estimate correlation errors, and eliminate the need for sensor calibrations. If successful, the FemtoSensor ASK instruments with much better figure of merits than ELISA ($240M market size/year) would enable many researchers in university, research institutes, pharma, hospitals/clinics, diagnostics companies, government/defense facilities, to develop many new assays for diseases. The proposed activity will advance discovery and understanding of bio-FETs, while also promoting academic and industrial learning and training experiences. Inclusion of MBA students for entrepreneurship will complement the science and engineering student team members and give a more rich opportunity for learning and practicing innovation. Existing outreach programs from the PI's NSF CAREER award will be leveraged for this project.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) project from Colorado State University will develop a state-of-the-art system integrating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions modeling, energy modeling, and life cycle assessment (LCA) for the built environment. This new Carbon Footprint Metric (CFM) system will mesh seamlessly with existing design and construction management tools that are widely used by architects, engineers and builders. The system will provide dynamic, real-time, 'on the-fly' carbon footprint measurements, all the way from the building concept stage through to construction and building completion and operation.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research begin with the opportunity to help reduce the environmental footprint of buildings and the built environment, which currently produce about 50% of total U.S. GHG emissions. A key element to changing behavior on the part of both building professionals and consumers are better environmental impact measurements. The availability of easily used yet rigorous and standardized tools for quantifying GHG metrics can dramatically change architectural and construction best practices. Once validated for each class of building, the CFM system will permit architects and construction practitioners to evaluate and alter building design in order to reduce energy use and GHG emissions over the life cycle of the building. Moreover, constructors can better evaluate construction methods and materials and building managers can exploit improved efficiencies to reduce GHGs. This will help the competitiveness and performance of the many small businesses that are among the pioneers in the "green" building industry. The system could further serve as a platform for urban planners and environmental managers to evaluate and plan improvements in a given built environment which encompasses many buildings and building types. The research and product development also have the potential to help transform the education and training of the next generation of architects, engineers, and product designers, who will be called upon to help build a more sustainable urban environment.<br/><br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are Colorado State University, with participants from four Colleges (Agricultural Sciences, Health and Human Sciences, Engineering, and Natural Sciences), along with three small business partners: 1) Living Homes (Santa Monica, CA) that has as its mission the design and creation of homes and communities which set a standard for the positive impact on soil, water, energy and health; 2) The Neenan Company (Fort Collins, CO) that has as its mission the design and building of highly sustainable commercial buildings, schools, and hospitals; and 3) Nemetschek Vectorworks (Columbia, MD) that has as its mission the production of versatile, intuitive, and affordable Building Information Modeling (BIM) software for professional design solutions to the architecture, engineering, and construction industries. Other partner: The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is a non-business partner that has as its mission research and development of alternative clean energy technology. Supporting institutions, which are leaders in advancing a more sustainable built environment, include the following: the American Institute of Architects, the U.S. Green Building Council, the National Institute for Building Science, Architecture 2030, and the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI).

Abstract: Rapid detection and surveillance of infectious agents is an unsolved challenge in the medical and biodefense communities. The lack of rapid and accurate diagnostics at the point of care (POC) has led to mismanagement of the newly developed drugs rendering them ineffective through the emergence of drug resistant pathogens. The PI proposes the development of a prototype instrument that does not require highly skilled technicians for POC settings. Issues which will be addressed in the development of the functioning field-deployable prototype include: (1) optimization of the illumination uniformity, (2) auto-focusing onto the sample, and (3) mechanical stability of the setup. The proposed instrument will be integrated with proven sample preparation techniques and evaluated against the bench top platform.<br/><br/>Successful development and launch of the proposed prototype will drastically improve the speed of disease diagnosis, expedite treatment options and ultimately produce better patient outcomes at a lower cost to the healthcare system. The simplicity and ease-of-use of the proposed system augurs well for the use of the technology in point-of-care settings and in providing improved healthcare in developing countries. In the proposed work, the industry participation and mentorship utilizing experienced entrepreneurs and executives will enhance the undergraduate and graduate educational experience by providing an environment for fostering entrepreneurialism and a parallel pipeline for talented engineers and scientist to industry. The strong ties of the executive mentorship program to the Boston business community also contributes to the economic development of the region by launching new businesses and job creation.

Abstract: This proposal focuses on developing well-suited materials for use in bindered anthracite briques that can replace conventional coke in foundry cupolas. The objectives of this NSF AIR project will be to: (1) Carry forward the market development of biomaterial-bindered anthracite briques as a replacement for coke in foundry cupolas, (2) Translate research-based results into full-scale market potential by conducting the research and development that resolves how industry can supply ultra-fine anthracite grains, mitigate potential brique biodegradation, and diminish air pollution, (3) Work with an anthracite supplier, two pulp miller, two cupola foundries, and others in industry, to demonstrate at full-scale this novel bindered anthracite opportunity. The needs and potential impact of having this replacement material, ultra-fine anthracite, for coke are clearly stated, where the environmental, financial, and industrial impacts are large. As stated in the proposal, this work will help advance the areas of sustainable manufacturing, high temperature bindering, ultrasonics, microbiology, coal processing, and wood (i.e., lignin) products. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this proposal could help the US coke industry in addressing the need for more manufacturing capability. The proposal puts forth alternative materials that require less energy to manufacture and release less CO2 and volatile organic carbon air emissions. Successful completion of this project will increase American business competitiveness by transforming otherwise wasted coal and biomaterials into value-added products, while sustainably making manufactured goods for the US population. The proposed research will also offer excellent opportunities for teaching, training, learning, and discovery relative to sustainable manufacturing. The PI also plans to bring a minority Ph.D candidate into this program to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups and integrating diversity into learning.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI: BIC) project from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) is based on the discovery of new designs for tomorrow's magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These designs enable the development of MRI systems that reduce significantly the use of helium. To understand this significance, global shortages in helium and the predictions that the situation is only going to get worse have seriously affected both industry and government. The report by the National Academy of Science in 2010 predicted that demand would exceed world supply by 2017. Up to now, liquid helium has been necessary to surround the MRI main magnets in a sufficiently cold 'bath' for their wire to be 'superconducting'. It is noted that superconductivity is crucial as it eliminates electrical power losses, enables high magnetic fields, and keeps the MRI operating under the ultra-stable conditions needed for high-quality imaging. The design breakthroughs for 0.5-3 Tesla magnetic field strengths prove that new higher-temperature superconducting material can be used for the MRI wire bundles, and the large helium bath can be eliminated. The intellectual merit lies in successfully modeling the MRI machine in order, for example, to find the exact mathematical placement of wire bundles that leads to the most uniform magnetic field possible with the least amount of superconductor wire. Three decades of work at CWRU have resulted in a unique and proven design technology for optimizing MRI coil magnets and hardware.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are significant. The world has already seen curtailment in standard MRI main-magnet manufacturing of high magnetic field MRI machines because of higher helium prices. If the global use of helium for MRIs is not reduced, the cost of MRI imaging will go up for the public. This will likely reduce the usage of MRI at a time of expressed desire for the expansion of human healthcare. Academic and industrial budgets for superconducting magnet research have been hard hit by increased helium costs. A MRI main magnet with no liquid helium bath, yet with performance rivaling the standard shielded 1.5-Tesla superconducting MRI system, will have significant impact on the global market place. The two primary partners, Hyper Tech and Quality Electrodynamics, and five other companies (ViewRay Inc., AllTech Medical Systems, GE Healthcare, Philips Healthcare, and Toshiba Medical Systems) which have prepared strong letters of interest, provide evidence of this impact through their expressed enthusiasm for the project target. The immediate takeaway for Hyper Tech, as a primary partner, is a final set of prototype-ready magnet blueprints, with both high and low magnetic field options, and a viable commercialization path for an important application of its superconducting wire product. For Quality Electrodynamics, the other primary partner, the takeaways start with the support hardware designs for the complete MRI system, as new manufacturing products, and extend to a possible major partnership with Hyper Tech for in-house main magnet manufacturing. Additionally, all 7 firms not only seek to participate in this exciting technical venture, they also want an inside track to recruiting the next generation of highly educated imaging personnel trained in the program. Upwards of 60 undergraduates, graduate, and postgraduate MRI alumni, including the entrepreneurial degree holders, have come out of the CWRU physics group, many of whom now work with a dozen companies that have partnered with the group throughout the years. Future students as well as new MRI magnets are key outcomes of the present MRI design program.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are the lead academic institution and the two primary small business partners. The principal unit of the lead institution is Ohio Platform for Tomorrow's Industrial Medical Imaging Systems and Equipment<br/>(OPTIMISE) in the CWRU physics department. OPTIMISE is an outgrowth of a long and rich history of research and education carried out with other CWRU units: the biomedical engineering, chemistry, mathematics, and radiology departments, and the CWRU pioneering entrepreneurial physics master's degree program. The two technology-based business partners are Hyper Tech Inc. (Columbus, Ohio) and Quality Electrodynamics (QED) LLC (Mayfield Village, Ohio).

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translation of a new wastewater treatment technology to fill the wastewater nitrogen treatment technology gap. The translated technology has the following unique features: conversion of ammonia to nitrous oxide, use of nitrous oxide to oxidize methane in biogas, and enhanced recovery of energy that provides exemplary opportunities for protection of waterways from nitrogen pollution while decreasing energy usage, decreasing residual solids for disposal, and increasing energy recovery compared to the leading competing technology (conventional nitrification and denitrification) in this market space. The project accomplishes this goal by short-circuiting the conventional nitrogen removal process, converting waste ammonium to nitrous oxide and using nitrous oxide to oxidize biogas for energy recovery resulting in on-site proof-of-concept with nitrogen-rich wastewater generated during the anaerobic digestion of organic matter at leading wastewater utilities in the San Francisco Bay area. <br/><br/>The partnership engages East Bay Municipal Utility District (Oakland, CA), South Bayside System Authority (Redwood City, CA), and Delta Diablo Sanitation District (Antioch, CA) to provide guidance in the wastewater treatment sector and other aspects: financing, commercialization, adaptation of existing infrastructure, and scale-up, as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The expected economic impact is $300k to $500k in annual operational savings at treatment plants that adopt the translated technology, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in wastewater treatment within 3 to 5 years. The societal impact, long term, will be the development of a cost-effective technology for removal of nitrogen from wastewater, preventing fertilization of waterways and potential for formation of destructive anoxic dead zones while also creating opportunities for energy recovery, converting nitrous oxide from harmful greenhouse gas to a new source of renewable energy.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity project from University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-M), entitled, "New Substrates Enabling Next Generation Optical Devices: Solar Cells to Lasers," exploits the recent innovations in the form of 'virtual' substrates developed at the University of Wisconsin to provide new materials required for opening market capabilities in the areas of optoelectronic devices, specifically light emitters, in new wavelength ranges and solar cells. These materials will be developed through the industrial partnerships that provide them with a competitive advantage in burgeoning niche markets available for such devices. The use of the hydride vapor phase epitaxy growth of GaAs and related compounds provides the capability to create new types of substrates, 'virtual' substrates, which serve as new device, and hence, manufacturing platforms for optoelectronic devices. The high achieved growth rates and control over composition has enabled the formation of semiconductor substrates with a surface that can have a lattice parameter not accessible by commercially available bulk semiconductor substrates. These ultra-thick metamorphic buffer layers transition between a commercial substrate and an epitaxial surface layer which have differing lattice parameters. The resulting surface lattice parameter is tunable, enabling new classes of devices spanning the spectrum for the industrial partners from solar cells to high-performance quantum cascade lasers. The partnerships developed in this project allow for the development of a new capacity for translational research at UW-M through the integration of materials development, with intimate feedback from the industrial partners in terms of design and materials metrics that arerequired for the use of such new materials.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project result from 1) the impact on technologies that benefit society, create new markets, and provide unique materials for market entry in the area of optoelectronic devices; 2) the human capital acquired by the participants, especially the graduate and undergraduate students; and 3) the inclusion of undergraduate interns in an environment where the impact of engineering and the generation of new products are readily apparent. This proposal serves to drive these industrial-academic interactions towards the mindful development of other materials built on a new perspective of technology transfer. Industrial partners gain access to materials enabling classes of devices resulting in the expansion of the markets for high performance and specialized semiconductor optoelectronic devices. This partnership will bring to an enhanced level of utility and development a class of 'virtual' and potentially re-usable substrates enabling the widespread development of novel classes of devices previously unachievable through the use of current commercial substrates. The formation, preparation, and processing of these new substrates is carried out in the context of their end-use in the areas of high-performance quantum cascade lasers, new quantum well infrared solid-state lasers, and high-performance multi-junction solar cells. The co-development of these materials by UW-M and the industrial partners will demonstrate and enable optoelectronic devices no longer constrained by lattice-matching to commercial substrates. The UW-M researchers gain knowledge of the design of materials based on the understanding of the product development cycle and those key technological issues which must be addressed to impact new markets.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are the University of Wisconsin-Madison through an interdisciplinary effort between the Departments of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Electrical and Computer Engineering; and three small businesses: MicroLink Devices Inc. (Independent), est. 2000 (Niles, Illinois) has a core business in the design and manufacture of III-V epitaxial material used in cellular phones and other wireless devices; nLight Inc. (Independent) est. 2000 (headquartered in Vancouver, WA) focuses on specialty high-power semiconductor lasers developing material solutions for medical, defense, and semiconductor solar applications. Intraband LLC (UW-M Start-up company), est. 2007 (Madison, WI) is an early-stage startup with the objective of commercializing the quantum cascade laser (QCL) technologies.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity project from Utah State University (USU) is designed to move the unique properties of spider silk from the laboratory to the marketplace. Spider silks exhibit excellent strength and toughness simultaneously, a feat unachievable in most synthetic structural materials, and it has a thermal conductivity equivalent to copper. At USU, recombinant silks closely mimicking natural spider silk sequences have been developed and synthesized. The discovery and early development of spider silk?s properties has led to the current point of joint technology-oriented research with business and industry partners. Three industry partners and one non-profit collaborator all have potential of developing spider silk products. This project will produce bio-inspired fibers with materials properties specifically appropriate for each of the partnering companies? possible product prototypes. This research will combine expertise and resources to make it possible to move spider silk technology toward products in three distinct areas: 1) biomedical applications, in particular micro-fine sutures for eye and nerve surgery; 2) composite materials from synthetic spider silk fibers; and 3) media for microbial fermentation and synthetic feed for silkworms designed to augment typical materials for production of the unique proteins. In addition, the unique thermal transfer properties of spider silk will be explored to assess its use in a variety of applications. The research will focus on which synthetic spider silks will be the best for the different possible uses, how to scale-up production of those spider silk proteins to levels that can be commercialized, and how to incorporate these fibers into the companies? prospective prototypes. <br/><br/><br/>The broader impacts of the research lie in the potential of the partnership to develop the products and techniques described above that will open up new markets due to the unique properties of these materials, which cannot currently be matched by any other materials. The new products envisioned would substantially increase the revenue for the partner companies, open up new product lines, and likely lead to increased jobs for them and downstream businesses. The companies will directly gain new technical skills such as electrospinning, fiber testing, methods for handling unique fibers, and testing methods for new feed media. In return, the Lewis Laboratory at USU will gain experience in composite material design and manufacture, 3D printing, rapid prototyping techniques, and methods for media analyses. Both the companies and the USU laboratory will gain access to unique instrumentation aiding both academe and industry in the future development of products from these unique materials. Also, importantly the development of media and diets to improve the production of the silk fibers will be crucial for production to meet expected demand. These partnerships can also lead to the use of spider silk in additional products in other companies. In addition to the research scientists participating in this project, students involved in this project will also gain valuable experience working with industry partners and with company scientists not only in the research, but also in the planning and design phases. Students will also have opportunities to present on their research and work with the PI in outreach efforts to give several presentations and tours on spiders and spider silk to K-12 students. The project will also provide hands-on workshops for the Engineering State conference for high school students with a particular goal of recruiting women and Hispanic students. This research area has continued to produce enthusiastic media attention for both the PI?s research and sponsors in the U.S. and internationally from multiple television networks. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are Utah State University (Synthetic Bioproducts Institute and United Science Technology Advanced Research(USTAR) and three primary small technology businesses: Caisson Laboratories, Inc.(Logan, UT); Iso Nano International, LLC (San Diego, CA); Zigg Design, LLC(Logan, UT; and a non-profit collaborator, Space Dynamics Laboratory(Logan, UT).

Abstract: This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the remarkable tunability of the abruptly discontinuous metal-insulator transitions of binary and ternary vanadium oxides discovered upon scaling to finite size and upon incorporation of substitutional/intercalative dopants to fill a critical technology gap in their deployment as dynamic glazing components of thermally switchable fenestration (doors, windows, and glazed skylights). The translated smart window technology has the following unique features: thermally switchable heat-blocking properties without a significant change in visible light transmittance, tunability of the switching temperature to meet the needs of different geographic climates, and voltage-driven induction of heat-blocking properties that provides exemplary savings in air-conditioning costs while allowing natural daylight to be used to light interiors of buildings when compared to the leading competing electrochromic and static metallic coatings in this market space. <br/><br/>The project accomplishes this goal by enabling investigation of scale-up of the synthesis of vanadium oxides, identification of optimal coating deposition methods, and allowing correlation curves and data tables to be compiled relating critical performance metrics to coating thickness and density resulting in a prototype energy efficient window. <br/><br/>The partnership engages a leading manufacturer of home windows, the Technology Accelerator Fund, and the Office of Science, Technology Transfer, and Economic Outreach at the University at Buffalo to provide guidance in the fenestration industry and other aspects such as market adoption, commercialization, and insulating glass unit design as they pertain to the potential to translate the smart window technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. <br/><br/>The potential economic impact is expected to be ca. $118 Million in the next 4 years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this area of green building materials and energy efficient buildings. The societal impact, long term, will be more energy efficient (even zero emission) buildings with a reduced carbon footprint and energy savings that have been estimated by some accounts to be as much as 1.0 quadrillion BTUs.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity project from Auburn University will be focused on building the basic foundations of a silicon-based high temperature integrated circuit technology. The final goal is to demonstrate a major polytype of silicon carbide (4H-SiC) metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect-transistor (that is, a 4H-SiC MOSFET)-based operational amplifier, operating at 250C or higher. 4H-SiC is a wide-band gap semiconductor with a high critical breakdown field, high thermal conductivity, good bulk electron mobility, high chemical inertness, and mechanical hardness. These properties make 4H-SiC an extremely attractive material for electronics operating in harsh environments and at temperatures higher than 250C, conditions under which conventional silicon-based electronics are very inefficient. In addition, the ability of SiC to oxidize to silicon dioxide, an insulator, naturally makes for MOSFETs. MOSFETs are voltage controlled electronic switches that are preferred over other devices as they offer a great deal of flexibility for circuit design. An efficient 4H-SiC MOSFET-based integrated circuit (IC) technology operating at high temperature will have a positive socio-economic impact in a variety of industrial and military applications. A limitation for employing 4H-SiC MOSFETs for this purpose is the low mobility of electrons in the conducting channel. This is primarily associated with a high density of traps at the oxide-SiC interface that results in carrier trapping and reduction of channel mobility. Recently, the Auburn group has demonstrated an advanced interface passivation process by incorporating phosphorus at and near the oxide-4H-SiC interface. This process results in a significantly reduced trap densities compared to the industry standard processes and accordingly results in at least a factor of two higher electron channel mobility compared to the state-of-the-art. The higher mobility is expected to result in significantly superior SiC operational-amplifiers. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the transfer of a fundamental materials science discovery to advanced applications taking future commercialization issues into consideration.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are increasing U.S. technological competitiveness, increasing the business viability of small business partners, and developing students capable of contributing to the semiconductor industry. A high performance 4H-SiC IC technology has the potential to open a variety of new applications areas and markets. Some notable application areas are sensing and control circuits for geothermal, automotive and aeronautical sectors. Such technologies will have significant positive impact on U.S. competitiveness. The increased innovation capacity of the small business partners resulting from the success of this program would set the stage for building commercial prototypes to penetrate niche markets, increasing their business viability, and thus a future role in the nascent silicon carbide semiconductor industry. The success of such a technology would also create new possibilities for other end-user application-oriented businesses. An important aspect of the program is related to the education of graduate students. Students involved in this project will be exposed to the "food chain of semiconductor technology", ranging from basic semiconductor materials science to technology development and applications during their master's or doctoral research. Hands-on training related to a wide range of scientific and engineering problems will result in the development of young, highly trained scientists for the U.S. semiconductor industry. Additionally, the program will include workshops for high school students and teachers. Finally, existing close interactions with Tuskegee University, a local historically black university will be consolidated in this program.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are the lead institution: Auburn University; and two small technology-based businesses: CoolCAD Electronics LLC (College Park, MD), which performs analysis, design and prototyping for cryogenic, SiC and infrared (IR) electronics; and United Silicon Carbide Inc.(Monmouth Junction, NJ), which focuses on the design, fabrication, and commercialization of SiC technologies.

Abstract: The proposed research will strengthen the CdTe PV innovation ecosystem. CdTe PV is now economically viable in many applications and suitable for gigawattscale implementation. The project will utilize CSU's state-of-the-art deposition system to pursue two separate routes to higher-efficiency manufacturing-friendly cells: (1) higher voltage from a new device structure that employs a Cd1-xMgxTe electron-reflector layer to reduce electron recombination, and (2) higher current with a larger band-gap CdS layer achieved by the incorporation of plasma activated oxygen species. The project will develop novel semiconductor alloys, novel processing methods, novel defect-passivation approaches, and novel device structures. At the same time, detailed understanding of the defects, interfaces, and the device physics of the advanced devices will be developed. <br/><br/>The most significant broader impact is the production of clean energy globally on an unprecedented scale. This will provide a major benefit for the U.S. economy and will create thousands of well-paying jobs in the U.S. It builds on the success of the CdTe PV industry, which now has the lowest cost-structure and largest production of any U.S. PV technology. . It also builds on the technology-transfer experience of the PI, co-founder of Abound Solar which has grown to 370 employees with current manufacturing at 65 MW/Yr and a near term target of 200 MW/Yr. This project will also provide well-trained students for the photovoltaic industry, which is growing rapidly and requires a highly skilled workforce. The PV-training approach at CSU is strongly team based: students from different disciplines work closely with each other, with engineers from industry, and in many cases with students at other universities.

The proposed approach and device structure consists of designing and implementing a prototype device that yields THz radiation at room temperature when excited by short optical pulses and/or high power CW lasers, with the added benefit of being easily tunable at THz frequencies and able produce coherent THz radiation with narrow bandwidth.<br/><br/>The Broader Impact of the proposed activity stems from the potential of the developed THz source to generate useful non-ionizing Terahertz radiation for medical imaging and, thus, provide an alternative to dangerous x-rays. With the support of the University's Alabama Innovation and Mentoring of Entrepreneur Center, this project will also train and engage students and a postdoctoral researcher in both entrepreneurial thinking and practice. This project will provide a platform for students and the postdoctoral fellow to establish a start-up company to translate the developed THz source technology to the marketplace.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity project from the University of Maryland, College Park, promotes the development of Resolution Augmentation through Photo-Induced Deactivation (RAPID) into a viable commercial strategy for semiconductor nanolithography. In conventional photolithography, a single wavelength (color) of light is used to expose an imageable material called a photoresist, and finer features are created by using light with a shorter wavelength. RAPID represents a new approach to photolithography in which one color of light exposes a photoresist causing a desired photoreaction that ultimately results in a developed image of a semiconductor circuit and a second color of light inhibits that exposure. This technique has been demonstrated to be able to create features that are far smaller than the wavelength of light employed. However, the underlying mechanisms of initiation and deactivation in RAPID photoresists are still poorly understood. The proposed research will elucidate the photochemistry and photophysics of RAPID and will provide the knowledge necessary to create RAPID photoresists that are suitable for the semiconductor industry. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to create photoresists that are capable of creating features of 10 nm or less with a spacing of 20 nm or less, all using visible light.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are far reaching. The continued progress in increasing the number of transistors that can be fit into a given space on an integrated circuit, which is embodied by Moore's Law, has been a major technological and economic driver over the past five decades. However, current approaches to improving the resolution of semiconductor nanolithography involve the use of radiation or charged particles with ever shorter wavelengths, which goes hand in hand with ever-increasing technological challenges and cost. These approaches have also reached road blocks that may prove insurmountable. The ability to perform semiconductor nanolithography using visible light, which is inexpensive to generate, propagate and manipulate, could be a game changer for the semiconductor industry and could give a major boost to U.S. competitiveness in this field. However, RAPID is a disruptive technology that is vastly different from the approaches currently being pursued in the industry and requires more development before it will be given serious consideration as an alternative to these approaches. The goal of the proposed research is thus to develop RAPID materials to a state in which they are compatible with the needs of the semiconductor industry, so that the industry can further transition them from the research laboratory to the factory. The proposed research will increase the viability of both participating small businesses, Period Structures, Inc. (PSI) and Lithoguru. The proposed work will position these businesses to play a leading role in the transition of RAPID into semiconductor nanolithography and other markets. PSI will be at the forefront of tool design and development for RAPID, while Lithoguru will have developed all of the simulation tools essential for modeling virtually any industrial implementation of RAPID. The graduate students who will perform the proposed research will work hand-in-hand with PSI and Lithoguru, gaining invaluable experience not just in small business and its culture but also in moving a research-laboratory discovery toward a marketable technology. By participating in this project, they will develop broad skill sets that will benefit their careers and will put them in a unique position to facilitate the ensuing transition of RAPID into the foundry or to develop tools and materials with further advanced capabilities.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are the University of Maryland, College Park and two small, technology-based businesses: Periodic Structures, Inc. (Los Gatos, CA, Austin, TX and Albuquerque, NM) and Lithoguru (Austin, TX).

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity project from Indiana University/Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) aims to address challenges of durability, cost, and efficiency in novel anion-exchange-membrane direct ethanol fuel cell (AEM-DEFC) technology coupled with the optimization of ethanol fuels to produce holistic, market-valued energy devices and fuel sources. The biggest limitation for currently commercialized low temperature fuel cells is the high cost and degradation of membranes and platinum-based electrocatalysts. AEM-DEFCs have several key advantages over these fuel cells: (1) faster, more efficient oxygen and ethanol reactions to produce more energy with less raw material; (2) wider choices of cheaper, non-platinum electrodes; (3) greater stability of fuel cell components; and (4) increased fuel safety and portability by using bio-ethanol. Since 2008, the PI's team has innovated and patented the technology for affordable, highly efficient polymeric electrolyte membranes and catalysts in anion-exchange-membrane fuel cells. The remaining challenge for advancing this early-stage technology to the marketplace is demonstrating its stability and efficiency in a wide range of applications and fuel types.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are to create technology alliances among partners that build innovation capacity from the unique multidisciplinary interaction of experts in fuel cell technology and adjacent fields. The innovation capacity of IUPUI will be increased through the establishment of integral partnerships to obtain AEM-DEFC component materials, fuel sources, marketing strategies, and fuels optimization research expertise. The innovation capacity of the small business partners will be reinforced through applications for their existing intellectual property by: 1) providing a new market for bio-ethanol fuel production (Xylogenics, Inc.); 2) expanding existing market strategies and prototyping and validation processes into fuel cell technologies (Faraday Technology, Inc.); and 3) refining AEMFC technologies by addressing the catalyst challenges in addition to membrane development (Tremont Technology LLC). More broadly, AEM-DEFCs have great potential to replace combustion-powered generators and rechargeable batteries for remote military operations and portable electronic applications, respectively, because of their high efficiency, portability, low-detection (lower heat signature), no battery recharge, and low cost. The timely development of efficient, durable, and cost-effective AEM-DEFCs and corresponding bio-ethanol fuels is imperative to meeting current and future energy demands while reducing operating costs and military vulnerability through locally-source bio-fuels. Commercialized AEM-DEFCs will have local impact by revitalizing industrial and rural economies and global impact by alleviating pressure on non-renewable resources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are the lead academic institution: Indiana University/Purdue University Indianapolis, including the Department of Engineering and Technology, the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and the Richard G. Lugar Center for Renewable Energy; small technology-based business partners: Faraday Technology Inc. (Clayton, Ohio), Tremont Technology LLC (Fishers, Indiana), and Xylogenics Inc.

Abstract: This Partnership for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity project from the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory-University of Minnesota (SAFL) seeks to 1) leverage novel computational fluid dynamics algorithms and experimental techniques developed by SAFL, the unique marine and hydrokinetic (MHK) energy field facilities and industry-leading expertise of Verdant Power, Inc. (VPI), and advances in material science and manufacturing of composite blades by Energetx Composites, Inc. (ECI) to tackle major technological and environmental roadblocks hindering commercial development and wide-spread deployment of technologies for harnessing MHK energy resources; and 2) contribute toward educating the next generation workforce for the MHK industry with emphasis on Native American students. A three-pronged research plan is proposed aimed at 1) Designing and testing via fluid-structure interaction computational tools the next generation of MHK turbine rotor blades optimized for reliable and efficient operation in real-life aquatic environments; 2) Optimizing via site-specific computational modeling the layout of VPI's pilot-scale 30-turbine, 1.05MW array to be developed in the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy (RITE) site in the East River in New York City; and 3) Developing and demonstrating the utility of the computational tools for quantifying and mitigating environmental effects due to coupled MHK array-geomorphology interactions. At the core of the educational plan of this project is the collaboration with Salish Kootenai Colleg (SKC), which will seek to enrich the 4-year degree program of this college with technological and entrepreneurial content focused on MHK energy. The computational framework to be used in this project is able to carry out high-resolution simulations of turbulence in arbitrarily complex waterways with embedded natural and/or man-made hydraulic structures and/or MHK turbines and multi-turbine arrays, taking into account hydro-elastic effects of turbine blades, and the interactions between turbines and waterway morphodynamic processes. This computational framework will be further developed and demonstrated in a real-world MHK project by leveraging the industry-leading expertise and unique field facilities of the two small business partners. The resulting simulation-based toolbox will be translated to the business partners to provide them for the first time with in depth mechanistic understanding of how turbines perform in and interact with real-life aquatic environments; and a powerful simulation-based engineering science toolbox for site-specific optimization of turbine arrays for efficiency and environmental compatibility.<br/><br/>Technologies for harnessing clean and renewable energy from MHK resources are currently at the pre-commercial stage of development and a number of technological and environmental challenges need to be overcome for this emerging industry to impact the nation's economy and renewable energy portfolio. Today, the U.S. MHK industry is at a stage similar to the early days of wind power technology prior to the emergence of a viable industry. Due to market pressures confronting small businesses in a nascent industry sector, the innovation capacity of companies like VPI and ECI is seriously impaired. The proposed PFI will enable both industry partners to leverage unique state-of-the-art simulation tools and emerge as international leaders in the MHK industry. Furthermore, the success of VPI's highly visible RITE project in New York City will provide a major boost to the entire U.S. MHK industry sector and help accelerate the wide-spread deployment of MHK energy technologies throughout the nation. The PFI educational plan will provide pilot content for the SKC Hydrology degree program that will uniquely link a Native American reservation with promising new technologies at a point where technology and entrepreneurial development are happening simultaneously; open-up a new potential marketplace for MHK technology in rural communities on a Native American reservation; and pilot this effort as a model for implementation in other rural communities in the U.S. and in third-world countries.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are the 1) Lead Institution: St. Anthony Falls Laboratory at University of Minnesota-Twin Cities (College of Science and Engineering); 2) Small Business Partners: Verdant Power, Inc. (Roosevelt Island, NY) and Energetx Composites, Inc. (Holland MI); and an 3) Academic Institution: Salish Kootenai College (Pablo, MT).

Abstract: This Partnership for Innovation project is based on collaboration among Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University a.k.a Virginia Tech, three small businesses, and a utility partner. The proposed partnership focuses on the design and evaluation of smart grid sensing and control hardware and software that enable demand response programs to offer customer choices for efficient use of electricity at all levels. This capability is to be built through the development of a platform consisting of optimization- control algorithms and product conceptual designs based on electric utility requirements and customer preferences. The hardware designs include a smart power management system and wireless sensor-control devices for 240-Volt end-use appliances, which are necessary to implement efficient and flexible electricity demand control programs. The intellectual merit of this research is the design of advanced control and sensing technologies and algorithms that can serve as the interface between a utility and its customers to enable the implementation of cost-effective demand response programs while providing customer choice.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are (1) a potentially stronger local economy as a result of the innovative design of new alpha-prototype products that could lead to electric energy saving products in the future; (2) a local job creation opportunity through the development of a new line of business for the partner companies and others; and, most important, (3) a viable improvement in the economy at a national level as a result of more efficient operation of the power grid by coordinating supply and demand in an optimal manner. The proposed platform will allow the electric utility to operate its assets more efficiently, and, at the same time, will allow its customers to manage their power consumption without compromising their lifestyle or way of life. In addition, this project has received strong support from two public sector organizations in Virginia: the Arlington County government and the Center for Advanced Research and Engineering (CAER). The County of Arlington is in the process of developing a Community Energy Plan, which is expected to recommend extensive use of energy efficient devices and smart grid technologies to optimize the use of electricity in homes and businesses, thus reducing the county's carbon footprint. The outcome of this research complements this local need.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are all part of the Knowledge Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of Virginia Tech (Virginia Tech Advanced Research Institute (VT-ARI)); three small businesses: Advanced Manufacturing Technology, Inc. (AMTI) (Lynchburg, VA); EIT, LLC (Sterling, VA); and Innovative Wireless Technologies (IWT) (Forest, VA); and a private sector organization: Dominion Virginia Power (Richmond, VA).

Abstract: This PFI:BIC project from Tufts University will investigate newly discovered orally active analogs of the peptide hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1), to see whether it is possible to adapt them for use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). GLP-1 reduces blood glucose after eating by interactions with its receptor (GLP-1R) that signal increased insulin secretion, reduced glucagon secretion, slowed gastric emptying and increased satiety. GLP-1R agonists provide, arguably, the most effective therapeutic approach for achieving recommended blood-glucose targets in the management of T2D. However, the currently available GLP-1R agonists, exenatide and liraglutide, suffer the drawback, especially for chronic medication, of requiring injection. The goal is to develop a solid-dose formulation of a GLP-1 analog that combines convenience of oral administration with the therapeutic advantages. The digestion of peptide hormones via oral delivery is challenged by gastrointestinal (GI) proteases and the absorption barrier of the GI tract. In addition, the active lifetime of GLP-1 is greatly shortened by proteolytic degradation as a result of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) in the blood and tissues. The early-stage technology-oriented research of this project starts with the discovery by Dr. Bachovchin and co-workers of how to make GLP-1 more resistant to destruction by GI proteases, DPP4, and NEP. A combination of peptide chemistry and formulation in enteric-coated tablets will be used to achieve the oral bioavailability and glucose-lowering potency required for clinical use. The methods are also applicable to other peptide hormones of possible therapeutic interest. In this vein, the Bachovchin team has modified the appetite-suppressing peptide oxyntomodulin to provide resistance to DPP4 and NEP without disruption of the receptor-agonist activity required for homeostatic function. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project lie in its contribution to the solution of a large, costly public health problem. More than half of T2D patients fail to achieve recommended targets for glycemic control, leading to high rates of medical complications. The problem will grow as the number of diabetics rises to an estimated 300 million in 2025. The American Diabetes Association-European Association for the Study of Diabetes consensus recognizes GLP-1 analogs as potentially the most effective treatment; but market penetration suggests only a minority of patients currently receive their benefit. Avoidance of injections reduces prescription of exenatide and liraglutide. Development of a GLP-1 analog in convenient oral formulation would overcome this hurdle and in combination with lifestyle changes might help to slow or prevent disease progression in the increasing numbers of juvenile patients and prediabetics, who, because they are asymptomatic, are less likely to accept long-term injections. For Unigene Laboratories, Inc., the advances anticipated in the course of this project will further validate the versatility of the Peptelligence (TM) platform for solid-dose formulation of peptide-based drugs for oral delivery, and in turn increase its marketability as a service. For Arisaph and Unigene, given success, a drug candidate will result that could be clinically developed and eventually commercialized by research and development conducted in partnership.<br/><br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are 1) Lead Institution: Tufts University School of Medicine (Department of Biochemistry); and 2) Primary Small Business Partners: Unigene Laboratories Inc.(Boonton, NJ) and Arisaph Pharmaceuticals (Boston, MA).

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project from Cornell University will develop applications for high performance lubricants and non-flammable electrolytes for lithium ion and other advanced batteries. These applications will be generated utilizing a new platform technology of nanoparticle ionic materials (NIMs) discovered at Cornell. NIMs consist of inorganic core particles wrapped within a dense layer of organic molecules. Tethering mobile molecules to the tiny particle cores yields a family of nanoscale materials whose properties can be tuned to conduct electrical charge or serve as a lubricant, while not releasing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) because NIMs are solvent-free. Thus, used as lithium battery electrolytes, NIMs can be designed to provide competitive electrical conductivity and electrochemical stability for high performance, while eliminating the risks of conventional battery electrolytes employing flammable solvents. Likewise, in applications as lubricants, ultra-slippery gel-like NIMs greases and oils can be designed to enhance energy efficiency and longevity of high-performance machine components that present small tolerances and commensurate high contact pressures, yet demand stable lubricant mechanical properties over extended periods of time.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are enhancement of education and entrepreneurship, and an improvement in U.S. economic competitiveness. Since this project will facilitate commercial deployment of new hybrid materials in two high-growth technology sectors: electrical energy storage and high performance machinery (e.g. wind-turbines, heavy-duty trucks, and high-speed rail), significant economic multiplication of the initial funding investment is expected. For education and entrepreneurship, the project will educate engineering researchers in the structure-property-performance relationships of NIMs in partnership with both industrial partners interested in the scaling up of NIMs production and performance and with Johnson School of Business graduate students, who will assist project participants in adapting NIMs for these new applications and in transitioning these technologies to the marketplace. More broadly, interactions of the project participants with K-12, Research Experience for Undergraduates, Research Experience for Teachers, and Women in Engineering programs organized by the Cornell Center for Materials Research and the College of Engineering will significantly expand the educational experiences provided by the project. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of this project are all part of the Knowledge-Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of Cornell University (Department of Materials Science and Engineering, the KAUST-Cornell Center for Energy and Sustainability, Cornell Center for Materials Research, and the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Institute at the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management); two small businesses: NOHMS Technologies, Inc. and Primet Precision Materials, Inc.

Acoustophoresis is a low-power, no-pressure-drop, no-clog, solid-state approach to particle removal from fluid suspensions and is used to achieve separations typically performed with porous filters, but with none of the disadvantages of porous filters. The acoustic resonator is designed to create a high intensity three-dimensional ultrasonic standing wave resulting in an acoustic radiation force larger than the combined effects of fluid drag and buoyancy and is therefore able to trap and hold stationary, the suspended phase. The novelty is in the ability to create ultrasonic standing wave fields that can trap particles in flow fields with linear velocities in excess of 1 cm. High frequency (MHz), high-power, and high-efficiency ultrasonic drivers based on solid state switching mode amplifiers will be designed and developed. An embedded control solution using a Digital Signal Processor and microcontroller will be implemented to maintain resonance operation and control power delivery and acoustic trapping force. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are improved, green, and sustainable separation technology with applications such as environmental oil clean-up, bio-fuels production, and biomedical applications such as blood-lipid separation. The partners on project team are eager to develop this technology and create green jobs to provide a nascent manufacturing base in Western Massachusetts, a region devastated by a significant decline in its manufacturing base. The project brings together a unique team with proven innovators from several small companies, engineering faculty from across several disciplines, three graduate students, and eleven undergraduate engineering students. Efforts are being undertaken to include underrepresented minorities in the REU and MS programs.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are Western New England College, as the lead institution, with collaborators from the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Departments in the College of Engineering, and three knowledge-enhancing small business partners: FloDesign Sonics Inc. (Wilbraham, Massachusetts), UTX Inc. (Holmes, New York), and FloDesign Inc. (Wilbraham, Massachusetts). An additional partner is the University of Southern Maine.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation project proposes to develop multigraft copolymer-based thermoplastic elastomers by use of randomly spaced side chains, representing a more cost effective technique than the present technique which depends on difficult to produce evenly spaced side chains. Thermoplastic elastomers combine the desirable properties of crosslinked elastomers (like car tires) with low processing costs and recyclability of thermoplastics. This newly developed class of multigraft copolymer-based thermoplastic elastomers is called "superelastomers" and holds promise for improved processability and recyclability of rubbery materials used in many different products such as gloves, earbuds, condoms, nipples for baby bottles, etc. The superelastomers also have the potential to open up new applications for elastomer materials. These designer elastomers constitute a new concept where macromolecular architecture (the shape of the molecule) is used to create the desired property profile. Through partnerships and collaborations fostered by this project, the research team will progress from knowledge generated by fundamental research toward new products that will enhance U.S. competitiveness, and the partner companies will have access to new designer elastomer technology. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are the creation of new jobs to stimulate the economy, and the reduction of the worldwide carbon footprint by developing a new class of highly tunable thermoplastic elastomers that have the potential to both be recyclable and reduce energy consumption during manufacturing. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of this project are the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (Department of Chemistry, School of Business Administration, and Research Foundation), BBB Elastomers (small business, Knoxville, TN), Asius Technologies (small business, Longmont, CO), InaMei Skin Care (small business, Hadley, MA), MAPA GmbH (large business, Zeven, Germany), Fuji Film (large business, Dayton, TN), Technology 20/20 (non-profit, Oak Ridge, TN), and Venture Incite (regional venture capital firm, Oak Ridge, TN).

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation project from Rochester Institute of Technology entitled, "Partnerships for Innovation in Printed Devices and Materials", focuses on the use of direct-write material printing technologies and the applications made possible by their unique capabilities. Traditional microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) processing techniques are very well suited for a variety of applications. However, they are generally limited to a small set of standard materials, they are used with planar substrates, and they require clean-room environments. This project seeks to grow the universe of what is possible through the use of direct-write print technologies and a complementary photonic curing process. Direct-write deposition eliminates many of the material restrictions associated with MEMS techniques. Nano inks consisting of polymers, metals, ceramics, or composites can all be printed. The photonic curing process then enables one to cure, or fuse, high temperature printed nanomaterials without damaging surrounding low temperature materials such as polymers. The marriage of multi-material, multi-layer nano ink printing with low temperature curing opens the door to new applications using devices consisting of combinations of material types.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research will be economic benefits for the knowledge enhancement partners as well as end users of their technologies. Nano ink formulations optimized for Aerosol Jet printing and photonic curing will be developed. Aerosol Jet process enhancements aimed at multi-material deposition will enhance the ability to produce novel MEMS-scale devices. An archive of multidisciplinary webinars as well as lab activities that are incorporated into undergraduate courses and K-12 summer camps will be maintained. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and its small business partners, Optomec (Albuquerque, NM), NovaCentrix (Austin, TX), and Intrinsiq Materials (Rochester, NY). These four entities form the project's primary knowledge enhancement partners. Other large businesses supporting the knowledge-enhancement partners include Hewlett Packard, Kodak, Tyco Electronics, and Xerox.

Abstract: This Partnership for Innovation project from Cornell University will create carbon-based nanocomposite materials suitable for advanced batteries, super capacitors, and magnetic storage media. The approach relies on co-polymerization of inorganic and organic polymer precursors to create composite materials in which inorganic nanoparticles are uniformly embedded in an electrically conductive carbon host. This platform technology will be applied to the development of new high-energy battery cathodes and anodes based on metal/carbon, metal sulfide/carbon, and metal oxide/carbon nanocomposites. Batteries based on the new composite electrodes offer energy storage capacities four to five times higher than the most advanced units in use today and are expected to find applications in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles. By incorporating highly conductive graphene structures into the composite materials, the project further aims to develop supercapacitors with high power and high energy storage capacities for the power utility grid storage. In addition, the project utilizes mixed metal precursors to create composites based on metal alloys and inter-metallic nanoparticles that facilitate independent control of the magnetic permeability and electrical conductivity.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research ultimately will include acceleration of commercialization of several unique battery systems with potential market-changing impacts. The global market for secondary batteries alone was estimated to be $11-$13 billion in 2010 and is expected to quadruple by 2020. By bringing together researchers from Cornell University, known world-wide for their innovative contributions in the rechargeable batteries field, with two Up-State New York technology concerns possessing complementary expertise on materials synthesis, formulation, and manufacturing, the project creates a path toward commercial deployment of lithium battery systems that offer multiple unique features. These features include best-in-class energy storage capacity and best-in-class power density. The project will also develop materials and manufacturing processes for battery electrodes, supercapacitors, and magnetic materials that are familiar from other sectors of technology. By doing so, costs associated with deployment of battery manufacturing processes will be contained--a required first-step for improving competitiveness of the new lithium battery systems in the marketplace.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are Cornell University as the lead academic institution and<br/>Small Business partners Graphene Devices Ltd., Rochester, New York; and NOHMs Technologies, Ithaca New York.

Abstract: This Partnership for Innovation project from the University of Oregon (Eugene) proposes to develop the capacity to accelerate the commercialization of inorganic nano-particle technologies. Inorganic nano-particles consist of an inorganic (metal or metal oxide) core 1 to 100 nm in diameter surrounded by a shell of molecular or polymeric coatings. The wide variety of the physical properties of the core materials and the selective binding capabilities of the ligands and coatings comprise a versatile tool kit with commercial applications across nearly every industrial sector. However, commercialization of these nanomaterials has been limited by difficulties in translating the synthesis methods used during discovery research to reliable commercial scale production. This project aims to address research problems at the frontiers of nano-science by developing improved materials measurement and characterization techniques that will enable nanoparticles to be produced and their properties optimized, advancing the state of the art in nanoscience, and thus accelerating the commercialization process itself.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are related to economics, education, and diversity. The small companies that participate in the knowledge enhancement partners (KEP) group will develop production techniques that are reproducible, reliable, scalable, fast, efficient, robust, precise, and inexpensive. These improvements will enable large-scale economic opportunities in photovoltaics, solid-state lighting and display technologies. The project will enable the acceleration of the commercialization of nanoparticles in other sectors, including: energy storage, catalysis, information technology, cancer treatment, and environmental remediation. Students and faculty members who participate in this project will learn to conduct basic research in an explicitly technological and industrial context. The KEP will encourage the participation of under-represented groups by offering summer research experiences to community college students.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of this project include lead academic institution,University of Oregon,(Department of Chemistry, Materials Science Institute, Center for Advanced Materials Characterization in Oregon (CAMCOR), and Lundquist College of Business); Small businesses: QD Vision, Lexington, Massachusetts; Voxtel, Beaverton, Oregon; Dune Sciences, Eugene, Oregon; and Hummingbird Scientific, Lacey, Washington; and a Federal agency: The National Institute for Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland.

Abstract: This Partnership for Innovation project from Purdue University is aimed at fully enabling the commercial application of Modulation-Assisted Machining in the discrete products sector. By superimposing a low-frequency/small-amplitude modulation on the cutting tool, Modulation-Assisted Machining produces small, discrete chips, while dramatically reducing friction and energy dissipation in machining. The Modulation-Assisted Machining research platform will expand the range of application of this technology from the current stationary drilling configurations (developed and commercialized via prior NSF support) to a wide range of rotating tool applications in drilling, turning, boring, trepanning, and related processes. Benefits include greater than two-fold increases in production rate, and large reductions in tool wear and machining emissions. Equally important, the platform will provide for development of robust methods for effecting power transfer to rotating tools and machines in the discrete products manufacturing sector.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are higher productivity, improved product quality, greater use of higher performance alloys that cannot be manufactured economically by conventional machining, and major reductions in machining emissions with associated environmental benefits. These are a consequence of enabling the implementation of Modulation-Assisted Machining across high-performance machining applications. The platform will also offer new cost-effective routes for powder materials manufacturing, and improved cutting techniques for orthopedic surgery.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are Purdue University (Schools of Industrial, Materials and Electrical & Computer Engineering), M4 Sciences LLC (West Lafayette, IN; Type II small business) and American Micro Products (Batavia, OH; Type I small business), all Knowledge Enhancement Partners; complemented by other partners: Cummins Inc.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation project from University of Florida is focused on developing the nuclear moment imager (NMI) which is a technology that utilizes the directional nature of highly sensitive optical magnetometers to collect an MRI-like image in only seconds without the use of large permanent magnetic fields. It functions more like magnetic tomography than a conventional MRI, in that the magnetic fields from the subject are imaged directly. It can be made portable, and it will be relatively inexpensive compared to MRI. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research include applications and research in areas as diverse as medical imaging for head trauma, industrial product inspection, agricultural pest control, scientific study of biological processes, ground penetrating imaging, and agricultural product inspection. The nuclear moment imager has the potential to affect many areas of everyday life in such widely varying areas as medicine, agriculture, science, industrial inspection, and other areas yet to be envisioned. One particularly exciting potential application is in third world countries, where the availability of a relatively inexpensive MRI-like imager that could travel with mobile medical teams could change the way "bush medicine" is practiced. The NMI platform and Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI: BIC) research will be housed as a part of the recently formed Center for Innovation Translation. This center allows students to move real-world research projects rapidly to the early prototype stage, thus educating them in early-stage high-tech startup skills, contributing to the overall regional entrepreneurial ecosystem. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project: University of Florida with the Microfabritech/Center for Innovation Translation, Materials Science and Engineering, Physics, Mathematics, Biomedical Engineering, and Radiology departments participating; Small businesses: Anitraks (Gainesville, FL),an imaging software development firm; Synogen (Gainesville, FL), a medical device development firm; and Medical Tool & Technology (Hawthorne, FL), a medical device prototype manufacturer. All of three of these businesses for profit companies that are fully engaged in the regional entrepreneurial ecosystem. Symmetricom (San Jose, CA), a world leading manufacturer of atomic clocks and atomic physics technology--has recently become a partner on this project and will be working to optimize miniature magnetometers for this application. In addition, the group has very active partnerships with the UF Office of Technology Licensing ,which routinely participates in nurturing entrepreneurial activities in the region,;the Innovation Hub, a newly formed one-stop-shop incubator that specializes in getting new technological business over the early startup difficulties; and the Sid Martin Biotech Center which is a biotechnology focused incubator near Gainesville that is working with more than 30 active small businesses.

Abstract: This Partnership for Innovation project from Arizona State University is aimed at developing a new approach to digital system design in order to significantly reduce the power consumption and size of digital systems without reducing their speed of operation. If successful, the results of this research can be used to improve the energy efficiency of nearly every digital system, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, cell phones and other handheld digital devices. This new approach employs threshold logic gates, which compute logic functions in a manner that is distinctly different from the way conventional logic gates operate. A threshold logic gate implements a complex logic function in a single primitive cell, which would otherwise require a network of many conventional logic gates. It is this absorption of logic into a single cell that is the reason for the reduction in power and size. A novel architecture for a threshold logic gate, called a differential threshold logic latch (DTLL), is proposed as the primitive logic cell.<br/>DTLL cells are compatible with existing logic gates, and can be used to replace parts of a digital circuit to reduce its power and area and possibly improve its speed. The resulting circuit will be a hybrid, consisting of DTLL cells and conventional logic gates. A significant advantage of the proposed approach is that DTLL cells can be implemented as efficiently as standard cells, making it possible to integrate threshold logic technology with existing Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) design methodology. To enable the integration of threshold logic with conventional ASIC design requires the development of design infrastructure, which includes the design of a threshold cell library, and a host of algorithms and software tools that transform existing digital designs into hybrid designs. This project will build such an infrastructure.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project will be benefits to performance of mobile electronic applications such as smart phones, cameras, laptops, etc. These devices will benefit the most from a reduction in power consumption delivered as a result of this project. A fundamental advantage of the approach taken in this project to reducing power consumption is that the technology of threshold logic is compatible with existing logic. As a result, the proposed approach is fully compatible with existing industrial design methodology. No new fabrication technology will be required, and existing commercial back-end design tools (e.g., synthesis, optimization, placement and routing) can be used for the hybrid netlists.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project: the knowledge enhancement partners (KEP): Lead institution: Arizona State University (Ira A.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation project from the Keck Graduate Institute(KGI) seeks to develop the key technical innovations for a compact, cost-effective, and user-friendly platform technology that can enable infectious disease diagnosis or industrial process monitoring at the point-of-care or point-of-use. The platform will use Raman spectroscopy to analyze organic compounds in the gas phase or in aqueous solution. A key technical challenge for VOC detection, which this project will address, relates to identifying and distinguishing VOC signatures at low concentrations in complex mixtures. Commercially viable platforms for use in the field or at the point-of-care also must be highly robust, easy-to-use, and cost-effective. This project employs a fundamentally different approach than currently marketed systems. The platform involves a disposable, VOC sample collection/pre-concentration device, which out-performs more elaborate existing devices at lower cost. To enable sensitive VOC detection, the platform uses an innovative Raman probe, which is more sensitive than conventional Raman probes, but circumvents the reproducibility problems encountered with Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy VOCs enriched and detected at the Raman sensor surface in a unique manner which also increases selectivity. The team will refine a preliminary variant of this sensor and will perform initial experiments aimed at understanding key system parameters, while simultaneously developing a second generation sensor probe with increased sensitivity, that is small, robust, and capable of being interfaced with a portable Raman spectrometer.The probe will further be adapted for measuring compounds in the liquid phase, specifically in complex aqueous solutions such as cell culture media. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of this research include rapid, near patient, and non-invasive diagnosis of ventilator associated pneumonia, wound infections, and active tuberculosis that can benefit patients in the U.S. and globally. Bioreactor process monitoring ensures a reliable supply of biopharmaceuticals. Enabling the development and commercialization of a novel platform technology that can address these applications has economic benefits for the small business partners directly involved in this effort, and for potential future business partners in the medical device and biotech industry, thereby enhancing U.S. competitiveness. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are the lead academic institution: Keck Graduate Institute (Claremont, CA), and an academic partner, the chemistry department at Pomona College (Claremont, CA). The project involves three small businesses as core Knowledge-Enhancement Partners: Tanner Research, Inc. (Monrovia, CA), Claremont BioSolutions (Upland, CA), and Lambda Solutions Inc (Waltham, MA). Other partners active in the specific targeted applications areas will be involved in the effort, including large companies such as KCI (San Antonio, Texas), leveraging KGI's strong connections with the biotech and medical device industry.

Abstract: This Partnership for Innovation project from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities will take a successful bioremediation technology previously used for pesticide removal from water and re-engineer it for use in microbiologically-enhanced coal-bed natural gas recovery from depleted gas wells and in bioremediation of the percentage of water returned via the well from waters generated during the hydraulic fracturing (fracking) method of drilling for shale oil, oil sands, and gas. The technology is based on encapsulating microorganisms in an inexpensive, safe, extended life-time, silica-based hybrid gel. The microbes are stabilized within the gel and continue to biodegrade pesticides for more than four months. In re-engineering the platform technology for enhanced recovery, communities of microorganisms that transform coal to natural gas will be stabilized by silica encapsulation for ease of transport, enhanced stability, and improvement of function. In re-engineering of the platform technology for bioremediation, microbes will be stabilized and rendered highly active to biodegrade organic contaminants within the percentage of water returned via the well from waters generated during the hydraulic fracturing (fracking) method of drilling. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are on possible future applications to an efficient and safe oil and gas industry. There is a strong link between a robust domestic energy sector and the creation of new jobs. The U.S. has recently become a net exporter of energy, credited largely to advances in shale oil and gas extraction that use hydraulic fracturing. This proposal develops technologies to enhance gas and oil recovery and a platform that can minimize the environmental impacts from a percentage of the water that is returned via the well and then kept in settling ponds. Two of the knowledge enhancement partners (KEPs) will take away technology to develop and scale-up production of silica-encapsulated, biodegrading bacteria that can be used for treating fracking water in settling ponds. Biostabilization imparted by the silica materials is also important for preserving microbial communities that transform coal to natural gas. One of the KEPs will take away this technology to enhance the ability to deliver microorganisms that increase natural gas production throughout the U.S. and potentially in foreign markets. This application is important because the U.S. has enormous coal reserves and enhancing coal to methane conversion will contribute to a clean energy future for our country.<br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project: the lead instituion, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities (Department of Biochemistry; Bioresource Center, Biotechnology Institute; Sponsored Projects Administration; Office of Technology Commercialization; Venture Center; and Office of the General Counsel; KEP core small businesses: 1) Luca Technologies (Boulder, CO) 3F LLC (St. Paul, MN) and 3) Tundra Companies (White Bear Lake, MN).

Abstract: This Partnership for Innovation project from the University of Notre Dame will discover, design, and translate ionic liquids (ILs) into new products and processes that are innovative and might eventually be ready to be marketed. Three target markets will be pursued: 1) development of processes to efficiently turn 'waste' heat into useful electricity; 2) finding new environmentally benign ways to deposit hard metal coatings on metal surfaces; and 3) developing improved 'ultracapacitors' (devices that store electrical energy and can be charged and discharged rapidly over millions of times). Each application will utilize an IL, defined as a pure salt that is liquid around room temperature. ILs are relatively newly discovered compounds that have many unique properties not found in conventional liquids, such as virtually no vapor pressure, inherent electrical conductivity, high thermal stability, and large electrochemical windows. These properties will be exploited in this project to develop new products and processes that address large market needs. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are that it will address issues across multiple cross-sections of society that are of critical importance to the U.S. and world economy. It will provide hands-on technology design and implementation opportunities in the area of ionic liquids. In the long term, there will be opportunities to optimize candidate ionic liquids for several production-scale applications while at the same time reducing volume manufacturing costs. The project will allow two small, Innovation Park Notre Dame-based businesses to help South Bend, Indiana, a traditional Midwestern manufacturing city, re-invent itself. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of this project are the University of Notre Dame (lead institution, Notre Dame, IN). Small businesses: Echogen Power Systems Inc. (Akron, OH); Ionic Research Technologies LLC (South Bend, IN); Neo Industries LLC (Portage, IN). Large businesses: Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (San Diego, CA); and United Technologies Research Center (East Hartford, CT). Additional partner organizations that are not part of the KEP groups are the Notre Dame ESTEEM professional science and engineering master's program, Innovation Park Notre Dame, Michiana TechConnection, and the Notre Dame Master of Science in Patent Law program.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project from the University of Texas-Dallas seeks to develop a multifunctional microelectrode array platform technology that has the potential to revolutionize how neuroscience research is conducted. Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) have provided significant insight into how the nervous system receives, processes, and transmits information. With the ability to stimulate and record from cells within the nervous system using MEAs, neuroscientists have been able to probe neural circuitry and examine the underlying spatiotemporal dynamics in health and disease. The overall goal of this partnership is to develop and productize a microelectrode array platform technology for neuroscience that is in turn capable of successively producing increasingly complex high performance devices. The vision is a multifunctional MEA platform technology that incorporates: 1) multichannel optical stimulation, using embedded organic light emitting diodes for selective neurostimulation; 2) shape memory polymers to provide a more robust, long-lived interface with the nervous system; 3) embedded microsystems based on thin-film transistors and piezoelectric polymers for on-board signal processing and micro-positioning of electrodes in vivo; and 4) low-cost, disposable fabrication materials and methods for in vitro neuropharmacological assay use. The project team proposes to develop this novel multifunctional MEA platform technology by leveraging advances in flexible display technology and materials science, demonstrating this technology platform in both in vitro and in vivo neuroscience studies. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research will include the resulting technologies that will be productized in various embodiments for use in clinical research and treatment. Because the proposed MEA platform is based on materials and processes that have been developed for the flexible display industry, a clear path to large volume manufacturing has already been demonstrated. In addition to the technology to be developed, which will open up whole new areas of research in neuroscience, the graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project will be exposed to a wide array of science and technology, ranging from semiconductor processing to neuroscience. They will also learn a tremendous amount about systems engineering, because, while the bulk of the project is about microelectrode array development, the arrays have to be compatible with the recording and stimulating electronics and software. Even more important, the students have the opportunity to work with proven entrepreneurs, such as Harvey Wiggins, the founder of Plexon. Mr. Wiggins has taken Plexon from a one person operation to the leading manufacturer of neuroscience recording hardware and software in the world. The students will be involved in the entire innovation process, including product definition, product design, process development, product fabrication and testing and finally marketing. UT Dallas' High School Comets program will also get local high school students involved in the project. The ultimate goal of the program is to create a technology platform that will create high paying jobs for students like those involved in this project, and, at the same time, benefit society by providing a new set of tools for neuroscientists to solve the most pressing medical problems. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are all part of the Knowledge Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting consisting of the University of Texas-Dallas (Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Neuroscience) and two small businesses: Plexon, Inc. (Dallas, TX), the leading manufacturer of neural recording equipment and software in the world, which will provide the team with expertise in electrical engineering and computer science; and Syzygy Memory Plastics (Atlanta, GA) which will provide expertise needed to develop the appropriate polymer substrate materials for both in vivo and in vitro multielectrode arrays.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project from Iowa State University (ISU) is based on the overarching goal of developing an effective and adaptable system for disease control in farmed shrimp. The project emphasizes two emerging technologies RNA interference--(RNAi) and nano-structured materials--to function in concert as an antiviral effector molecule and delivery system, respectively. Infectious diseases caused by viral pathogens account for substantial mortality in farmed Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and result in devastating financial losses. The aim of this project is to rapidly develop highly specific RNAi-based antiviral molecules to protect individual shrimp from emerging viral infections. These antiviral molecules will be combined with a nanoparticle substrate so that the antiviral can be delivered orally to individual shrimp during the rearing process. The goals and predicted outcomes of this project will result in a platform system that can be rapidly adapted to respond to ever-evolving and emerging infectious disease issues in shrimp farming. Therefore, the project has strong potential for sustained innovation and to transform disease control for this industry. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project, beyond those for the partners, are economic benefits to the U.S., including the following: 1) Stable or even lower consumer prices for a high protein seafood product supplied from an industry that would dramatically increase its supply, if vaccines were available; 2) benefit to U.S. companies that export wheat and soybeans-- the two main ingredients in shrimp feeds--along with U.S. feed companies that export high tech microencapsultated larval feeds to shrimp hatcheries worldwide; 2) producers of breeding stocks of shrimp, 3) sustainable and predictable harvests for domestic shrimp producers, and 4) positioning the U.S. as the leader in the aquaculture biotechnologies needed for shrimp/fish farmers to supply future increases in demand for seafood that the capture fisheries cannot meet. Broader impacts will also be witnessed through training junior scientists at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels in a manner that will advance their capacity to practice science in an environment of entrepreneurialism--balancing bench work and scientific advancement with the demands and timelines of business. Trainees will benefit from academics and professional development mentoring at the lead institution and from regular interactions and time with the employees and leadership at the associated knowledge-enhancement partner companies. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project are all part of the Knowledge Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of Iowa State University (Department of Entomology) and two small businesses: Harrisvaccines (HV) (Ames, IA) and Liquidia Technologies (LT) (Research Triangle Park, NC).

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovations (PFI) project partners Dartmouth College investigators and students with small businesses in the research and research translation of novel mechanisms and associated computational platforms for low power, high throughput signal processing that will translate to new technologies and products for sensory enhancement and for mobile sensor systems. The intellectual merit of this project derives from its focus on research and translation of the novel signal processing mechanisms of neuronal systems to low power analog and mixed-signal devices and the subsequent use and reuse of these mechanisms across applications that demand low power and high throughput. Example applications include a new imaging device that substantially improves image quality by sensing single photons and moving signal processing functions close to the sensor; an auditory device for focused listening in noisy environments; body-worn devices for biomedical monitoring and enhancing biomechanics performance (e.g., in athletes, disabled, or elderly people); remote, wireless monitoring of machines and structures (e.g., wind turbines, aircraft, bridges); and wireless sensor networks. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are the strengthening of Ph.D. level education to include training in entrepreneurship and new venture creation; the economic impact on Knowledge Enhancement Partners (KEPs) associated with broadening markets for their products; and an impact on regional small technology companies through increased visibility in attracting and hiring technical staff. The effort builds on a strong foundation in innovation within the academic programs of the Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College. Thayer School offers the nation's first doctoral-level Engineering Innovation Program designed to provide Ph.D. graduates with the entrepreneurial training needed to turn research discoveries into marketable technologies. Grant funds are leveraged by internal fellowship funding, providing these students with a five-year opportunity for collaborative research with partners, for research translation, and for technology development stemming from PFI activities. Activities with local non-governmental organizations that support regional economic development focus on programs, promotional materials, and websites to attract and retain intellectual capital within New Hampshire and Vermont and to attract new small technology companies to the region, thereby promoting economic development on both sides of the Connecticut River. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of the project include the Knowledge Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of Dartmouth College's Thayer School of Engineering and five small businesses: Forza Silicon (Pasadena, CA), MicroStrain, Inc. (Williston, VT), Neuromorfix, Inc. (Atlanta, GA), Simbex, LLC. (Lebanon, NH), Sound Innovations Inc. (White River Junction, VT). In addition, there are other partners.

Abstract: This Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) project from SUNY at Stony Brook a.k.a. Stony Brook University, brings together a small business-academia innovation team to capitalize on emergent opportunities in thermal spray (TS) deposition of functional oxides for applications in high temperature sensing and electrical energy conversion systems. It has long been appreciated that successful development of functional oxide deposition via TS (a platform technology) would provide an enabling new capability for a high rate, economical approach to large area deposition of components in fuel cells, batteries, and a range of thick film sensors. Many of these inventions have been contemplated for several decades but have not been translated into innovative applications, largely due to the complexity in materials science of TS systems as well as to limitations in process science and control. Over the last decade, much has changed in both knowledge and technology which has resulted in a reconsideration of the capability for functional materials systems. However, in order to push the capability of TS to play an active role in thick film manufacturing, new process science ideologies aimed at improving functional properties and enhancing reliability must be implemented. Furthermore, scientific endeavors in academia must be leveraged with entrepreneurial pursuits in small businesses to demonstrate the viability of TS to meet rigorous requirements in sensor and energy systems. The intellectual merit stems from the ability to introduce academically derived, sophisticated scientific concepts such as advanced diagnostics and process maps into industrial manufacturing practice. Successful development of the proposed technologies through the PFI will not only have immediate impact among the small business innovation partners, but also will provide a framework for consideration of TS expansion into the arena of functional materials. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research are numerous. Successful consideration of TS in sensors and energy systems will open the door to wide ranging opportunities including thick film devices, mesoscale electronics, and photocatalytic surfaces. It has the potential to bring down manufacturing costs and provide scaling for fuel cells and batteries enabling their wide spread utilization. It will also distill confidence in TS technology and enhance capabilities of small business service providers for both traditional and novel applications. Effective interactions among graduate, undergraduate students, and industrial innovators can influence and inspire a spirit of innovation in a generation of both engineering and business students. <br/><br/>Partners at the inception of this project includere the Knowledge-Enhancement Partnership (KEP) unit, consisting of the lead academic institution, Stony Brook University (Department of Materials Science and Engineering), and Boston University (Department of Mechanical Engineering); two small businesses: MesoScribe Technologies (St. James, NY) and Surface Modification Systems (Santa Fe Springs, CA); and one large business: Applied Materials (Santa Clara, CA). In addition, there are other partners. The partners include a private sector organization: Sutzer Metco (Westbury, NY);and three public sector organizations: Sandia National Laboratories (Albuquerque, NM), VTT Technical Research Center of Finland (Helsinki, Finland), and the Institute of Plasma Physics (Prague, Czech Republic).
