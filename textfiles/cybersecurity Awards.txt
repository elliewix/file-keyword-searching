Abstract: For nearly 40 years, the United States has faced a critical problem: increasing demand for energy has outstripped the ability of the systems and markets that supply power. Today, a variety of promising new technologies offer a solution to this problem. Clean, renewable power generation, such as solar and wind are increasingly available. Hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles offer greater energy efficiency in transportation. The power grid that manages the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power, however, was designed and constructed in the 1960?s and is ill-suited to handle these emerging energy technologies. Operating the electrical grid using power sources with random and uncertain availability, like solar and wind, requires new sensing and control methods. Widespread use of plug-in/hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) will not only require far greater power capacity, but will also radically change the peak usage profile, with large evening demand that cannot be shifted. To address this problem, our current power grid must be upgraded with a control system that uses the full power of modern sensor and computing technology to increase efficiency. This new power grid, with an integrated, modern IT control plane is commonly referred to as the Smart Grid, which uses distributed control, customer integration and market based control mechanisms. <br/><br/>It is critical to build security features into this Smart Grid from the beginning to ensure fairness, to provide warnings of misuse, to provide control algorithms that minimize damage from malicious behavior, and most importantly, to provide robustness and high-availability of power delivery even in the presence of bad-faith actors. This project develops methods to achieve security in power and market delivery. This entails a study of economic market models with stability as one objective but also in consideration of new sources of power and usage, both on the producer and the consumer sides. To achieve security, the following techniques are used synergistically: vulnerability discovery by formal analysis; on-line monitoring, anomaly and specification-based intrusion detection; and recovery and reconstitution by feedback control. Unique to this project, it is emphasized that the security enhancements take place at both the market level and the system level, requiring separate state-estimation models. These seemingly disparate domains are unified through mapping functions among the states of the respective models. By integrating the two control models, future Smart Grids can detect and respond to activity, either malicious or caused by natural disturbances, that threaten either level; the unification of the models permits the investigation of attacks that possibly impact both levels. Results of this work would lead to a secure and reliable Smart Grid architecture that is robust in the face of attacks on both the power delivery and market control systems. The inherent cross-disciplinary nature of the research will educate future researchers to be conversant in both cyber-security and associated economic issues, through co-advising between the departments of Computer Science and Economics at both UC Davis and Pennsylvania State University and through course modules developed under this work, again involving both campuses. Results will be transitioned to partnership with PG&E, SMUD, the West Davis Village, and other utilities in California, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut.

Abstract: The security of critical information infrastructures depends upon effective techniques to detect vulnerabilities commonly exploited by malicious attacks. Due to poor coding practices or human error, a known vulnerability discovered and patched in one code location may often exist in many other unpatched code locations, either in the same code base or other code bases. Furthermore, patches are often error-prone, resulting in new vulnerabilities. This project develops practical techniques for detecting code-level similarity to prevent such vulnerabilities. It has the potential to help build a more reliable and secure information system infrastructure, which will have tremendous economical impact on society because of our growing reliance on information technologies.<br/><br/>In particular, the project aims to develop practical techniques for similarity-based testing and analysis to detect unpatched vulnerable code and validate patches to the detected vulnerable code at both the source code and binary levels. To this end, it focuses on three main technical directions: (1) developing techniques for detecting source-level vulnerabilities by adapting and refining an industrial-strength tool, (2) developing capabilities of detecting binary-level vulnerabilities by extending preliminary work on detecting code clones in binaries, and (3) supporting patch validation and repair by developing methodologies and techniques to validate software patches and help produce correct, secure patches. This project helps discover new techniques for source- and binary-level vulnerability analysis and gain better understandings of the fundamental and practical challenges for building highly secure and reliable software.

Abstract: The economics of Cloud Computing Cloud Computing impels a fundamental shift in how data services are deployed and delivered, enabling flexible, dynamic outsourcing while reducing capital cost commitments for hardware and software. However, cloud computing also deprives customers of direct control over the systems that manage their data, raising security and privacy concerns. This research develops the means to provide secure and privacy-assured data service outsourcing that is usable, scalable, and meets performance goals, through: (1) an encrypted cloud data service, including fuzzy and ranked keyword search with strong privacy-assurance for large numbers of users and files, (2) scalable and owner-controlled cloud data sharing service with fine-grained data access enforcement and scalability, and (3) privacy-preserving secure cloud storage auditing that maintains strong guarantees of storage correctness.<br/>Enabling secure and privacy-assured data service outsourcing is fundamental to the success of cloud computing deployment. This project also develops curricula and teaches and supervises students. Materials of this project will be made available online as tutorials, software packages, and publications of general interest.

Abstract: The insecurity of most software update systems poses a major security risk. As a result, an attacker with a minimal amount of technical knowledge can cause a huge amount of damage to a huge number of computers. This poses a potential crisis for global security, with the scientific community a particularly likely victim. The scientific community possesses computational resources that are particularly attractive to hackers. The high speed networks and computation available to scientists would make an excellent platform for sending SPAM, flooding major sites with traffic to knock them off the Internet (DDOS), or even launching cyber-warfare attacks against US targets.<br/><br/>TUF (The Update Framework) is a tool, developed in prior research by the PI, to secure their new or existing software update systems. Software update systems are vulnerable to many known attacks, including those that can result in clients being compromised or crashed. TUF helps solve this problem by providing a flexible security framework that can be added to software updaters. This project will transition our TUF tool into practical use for secure package management. The added security will be completely invisible to users unless an attack is underway, silently preventing malicious package manager attacks from being effective. TUF provides unique capabilities for secure key revocation, private security update retrieval, and offline/online hybrid role protections. This work will protect millions of government systems, military servers, scientists, and average internet users from attack.

Abstract: Statistical privacy is the art of releasing the datasets that provide useful information about population trends without revealing private information about any individual. Recent high-profile attacks on datasets released by AOL and Netflix demonstrate the need for rigorous application-specific privacy definitions to guide the anonymization of data. The goal of this project is to develop modular components, called privacy axioms, that can be chained together to create customized privacy definitions and anonymized data for statistical privacy applications. Such modularity can enable data curators without extensive expertise in statistical privacy to release anonymized data while providing privacy guarantees that are more interpretable and reliable.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: this project is designed to provide a unifying framework for statistical privacy that can bring about a deeper understanding of privacy issues and provide guidance for the safe anonymization and release of sensitive data. In addition to theoretical developments, this research plan also targets specific existing applications at Penn State and the U.S. Census Bureau.<br/><br/>Broader impact: the systematic approach to privacy pursued by this project can enable access to and analysis of anonymized data in domains where access to data is otherwise heavily restricted. <br/>This project aims to build upon the investigator's prior experience with outreach programs such as the Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) by involving undergraduates in the proposed research. To prepare students for future work that requires analysis of anonymized data, this research is also being integrated into machine learning courses at Penn State.<br/><br/>For further information see the project web site at the URL:<br/>http://www.cse.psu.edu/~dkifer/axiomatizingprivacy.html

Abstract: The vast majority of the code in most applications comes from the libraries it imports, rather than the program itself. As a result, hackers often exploit flaws in libraries like glibc or openssl that are used across multiple applications instead of attacking individual flaws in code specific to the application. This makes it easier for an attacker to compromise many applications at once with a single exploit. This work isolates the impact of flaws in a deployed program into the smallest area possible. This will dramatically increase the security of applications in the cloud, on mobile phones, and everything in between.<br/><br/>To achieve this goal, this research develops a new abstraction that acts as a lightweight and extremely efficient intra-process isolation mechanism that builds on recent advances from operating system virtualization and memory-safe code execution (such as SFI). This abstraction, called a cage, allows different pieces of code that execute in the same process to be isolated from each other. This means that a flaw within a piece of code can only be used to exploit the code within that cage. Each cage also conceptually is its own process from an resource accounting standpoint. In addition, calls between cages are extremely lightweight and do not require a context switch or OS intervention. The cage abstraction provides an isolation mechanism that is high-performance and with very low overhead while improving application security.

Abstract: In response to serious vulnerabilities that plague many of the Internet's core protocols, the last two decades have seen various security infrastructures layered on top of originally insecure protocols (DNSSEC on top of the domain name system, SSL and its public key infrastructure on top of TCP, the RPKI on top of interdomain routing). The security of each is derived from centralized authorities that are trusted to provide information about cryptographic keys or identities. When authorities behave correctly, each security infrastructure protects the underlying insecure system from attack. However, what happens if an authority abuses its power, or experiences a malfunction, misconfiguration, or a compromise by an external attacker?<br/><br/>This project is predicated on the observation that the scope, impact, and visibility of abuse by compromised authorities is determined by the architecture of a security infrastructure (e.g., the presence or absence of hierarchy, the scope of an authority's power, etc.). The project finds new ways to balance between the need to provide strong security guarantees for a vulnerable insecure system, and the need to limit the control that a centralized authority can exercise over that system. To do this, the project will use cryptography and mechanism design to design architectures that make abuse easier to detect, or harder to execute. The project has implications on the security of some of the Internet's most crucial systems, and also involves technology transfer to the practitioners involved in the standardization and adoption of Internet systems.

Abstract: Overlay anonymity systems like Tor are effective against many kinds of attacks<br/>on privacy, but they have significantly slower network performance than regular<br/>Internet traffic. The purpose of this project is to explore the design of<br/>anon.next, an anonymity system for the next-generation Internet. In anon.next,<br/>we embed anonymizing proxies into new Internet architectures, so that the<br/>network itself can provide efficient and effective privacy protection in a way<br/>that overlay designs cannot. This project seeks to make major advances in two<br/>areas key to the design of anon.next. First, methods to construct<br/>high-throughput paths of anonymizing proxies to route the user's packets to<br/>their destinations with minimal leakage of privacy. Second, secure methods to<br/>locate those proxies without relying on centralized directory servers or<br/>exposing the users' packet routes. Both components require us to develop new<br/>metrics for the privacy provided by a given anonymizing path and by the system<br/>as a whole. We are conducting analysis and simulation studies and validating<br/>these with extensive experimentation on GENI testbeds. These efforts will<br/>provide major insights into the design of anonymity systems, which provide<br/>personal privacy as well as censorship resistance and protection for<br/>whistle-blowers, journalists, and intelligence services. Our project is also<br/>part of the large effort required to understand and design distributed systems<br/>in the next-generation Internet. This project involves students at many levels,<br/>including middle and high school students in summer camp settings,<br/>undergraduate students in research into finding new attacks against our<br/>systems, and graduate students.

Abstract: The world increasingly relies on computer systems and associated software, yet attackers continue to exploit vulnerabilities in this software to threaten security in new and sophisticated ways. This research views exploitations of software vulnerabilities as critical, but not unique, examples of innovations that society would like to discourage? many other examples (e.g., biological weapons, sports doping, terrorist devices, privacy intrusions) exist. Purely technical panaceas are unlikely; instead, given inherent residual risk, society needs to better understand how adversaries adopt technological innovation and the efficacy of measures to stem their diffusion. Using large-scale data analysis, this research builds on innovation diffusion theory to model how exploitations of security vulnerabilities spread through attacker populations. The study of the specific software security context (particularly regarding disclosure and transparency) can clarify the complex interaction between attack and countermeasure activity and help society benefit from technology while reducing concomitant negative consequences.<br/><br/>The project integrates a cohesive set of empirical studies based on a massive dataset of intrusion alerts augmented by the National Vulnerability Database and manual data collection. It combines theory from economics, computer science, and sociology with advances in analytical tools to build predictive models. While researchers recognize that deeper understandings of attacks and countermeasures are critical, they remain difficult problems. However, recent advances in analytical techniques combined with the availability of large datasets present an emerging opportunity to model and understand attacker behavior. The project also promotes awareness of security through a range of activities (including instructional modules, workshops, and course offerings), using the theoretical insights from the research program to promote diffusion of measures that counter security threats. Regardless of how the threat landscape continues to evolve, rigorous methods for modeling attacker behavior and diffusing information will remain crucial.

Abstract: As the Internet emerges as the platform for computation, we have become increasingly reliant on cryptography to provide privacy and security in many of our day-to-day activities. We rely on cryptographic protocols to protect our credit card numbers from hackers in electronic transactions and our personal information from unauthorized access on online social networks. However, the design of many cryptosystems do not adequately account for new computational and cryptographic attacks made possible by advances in quantum computing and complex protocol interactions on the Internet. The focus of this project lies in the design and analysis of new cryptographic protocols that address these new attacks.<br/><br/>The research is centered around two goals: (1) to develop cryptosystems from large classes of intractability assumptions as viable alternatives to the widely-used factorization-based cryptosystems; (2) to obtain new techniques and efficient protocols secure against coordinated attacks amidst concurrent protocol executions.<br/><br/>This research is expected to develop ideas and techniques which hold the potential to bridge the gap between theory and practice in cryptography, and to fundamentally change the way we communicate, compute and collaborate. To ensure broader impact of this research, this project also encompasses a program of educational and outreach activities, including curriculum development (with an emphasis on new pedagogical approaches) as well as collaboration and regular exchanges with research institutions in the New York area and abroad.

Abstract: Recent trends in computing have prompted users and organizations to store an increasingly large amount of sensitive data at third party locations in the cloud outside of their direct control. In order to protect this data, it needs to be encrypted. However, traditional encryption systems lack the expressiveness needed for most applications involving big and complex data. The continued adoption and deployment of cloud computing hinges crucially on the ability to provide cryptographic measures that protect the privacy of our data, and new encryption schemes have the potential to affect how successful this computing paradigm will be. <br/><br/>Functional encryption is an emerging paradigm for public-key encryption that enables more fine-grained access control to encrypted data. Functional encryption provides the ability to specify a decryption policy in the ciphertext so that only individuals who satisfy the policy can decrypt, or the ability to associate keywords to a secret key so that it can only decrypt documents containing the keyword. This project investigates methods to obtain more efficient pairings-based functional encryption, and methods to realize new functionalities and more expressive functional encryption schemes.

Abstract: Unauthorized online behavior motivated by social, political, economic and cultural (SPEC) conflicts is increasing. However, research dealing with cyber-attacks has tended to be reactive and to focus on defense, instead of proactive and focused on the root psychological and social causes of such attacks. Despite considerable evidence that trust and distrust impact rule-following behaviors and obedience to the law, little research investigates the role of distrust in promoting unauthorized online behaviors. Critically, trust/distrust research in other areas suggests the cyber-attacks might be reduced through interventions aimed at forms of distrust. Thus, advancing knowledge about distrust in general and in this specific domain is important both for social science and cybersecurity. <br/><br/>The present project will answer questions about whether different types of distrust have different effects on willingness to engage in or provide support for cyber-attacks, and will investigate the effectiveness of sociotechnical interventions designed to reduce unauthorized online behaviors. The central hypothesis is that relationships between distrust and unauthorized online behaviors (or support of such behaviors) depend on the specific bases of distrust, and require different remedies. The project will achieve its aims by the development of vignettes that systematically vary conditions likely to foster trust or distrust and motivation for unauthorized online behaviors. The effects of the variables manipulated in the vignettes will be tested in other groups of students using online experiments and simulation (role-playing) activities. The project will also develop and test an online deliberative space that can both take advantage of the research findings and provide an environment for theory-testing. Specifically, the online prototype will be able to manipulate key trust/distrust-relevant features of the deliberative space while measuring and tracking participant online behaviors, providing data that can then be subject to data mining procedures in order to find important patterns of behavior related to trust and distrust.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the current research is that it uses distrust as an organizing construct to understand individual behaviors and attitudes toward security in cyberspace and innovatively uses science communication as the specific application domain to investigate cybersecurity. By examining the antecedents and consequences of distrust, and by integrating a variety of research approaches, this research will both (a) advance theoretical models of trust and distrust generally, and (b) enhance the prevention of cyber-attacks specifically by providing insights that contribute to the design of institutions and interventions perceived as legitimate and obedience-worthy even in the context of culturally divisive issues. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of the proposed activities are that the research findings will contribute to the creation of online spaces for public engagement that encourage optimal behavior and reduce destructive and ethically questionable behaviors (e.g., cyber-attacks, hacktivism). The platform developed for our research will be widely applicable to studying problems in other domains, and can be used to further research, as well as in applied educational and policy contexts. Through this project, hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students will be exposed to topics beyond their discipline including cybersecurity, climate change and public deliberative engagement. Finally, by educating students about online deliberation, pros and cons of argumentative discourse, public engagement and policy making, we are training future scientists to be leaders and world citizens.

Abstract: The Greater Kansas Area Security Workshop (KanSec) provides a regular forum for researchers and students across Kansas and the neighboring states to present research and educational activities in the field of cybersecurity, and to promote interactions and collaborations. With three NSA/DHS National Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE) and IA Research (CAE/R) in the State of Kansas, substantial cybersecurity research and educational activities are taking place. KanSec was formed to encourage collaboration despite the geographical remoteness of the area. The first two KanSec workshops, in Spring and Fall 2012 respectively, included over 50 participants each, with about 10 student presentations at each event. The next workshop is scheduled to be hosted at the University of Kansas in the Spring of 2013, and has received inquiries about participation from universities in neighboring states including Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Arkansas. To improve the quality of the workshop and to give students better experiences, KanSec will invite renowned researchers as keynote speakers for future KanSec workshops.<br/><br/>This grant supports student travel to the KanSec workshops in spring and fall 2013.

Abstract: Language-based security (the use of programming language abstractions and techniques for security) holds the promise of efficient enforcement of strong, formal, fine-grained, application-specific information security guarantees. However, language-based security has not yet reached its potential, and is not in widespread use for providing rich information security guarantees.<br/><br/>This research makes language-based security techniques more practical, and thus helps improve the information security of new and existing computer systems. It does so through three complementary approaches.<br/><br/>First, this project develops techniques to make information security guarantees proportional to programmer effort, which both reduces the cost of entry for attaining formal information security guarantees, and allows incremental improvement of a program?Äôs security guarantees, as resources and requirements allow. Second, this project develops new ways to express and reason about rich information-security requirements, such as the required release of information, availability requirements, production of audit logs, and anonymity requirements. Third, information security in concurrent settings is addressed by exploring synergies with newly developed concurrent language mechanisms.<br/><br/>Techniques and mechanisms resulting from these explorations will be incorporated into a new programming language that helps programmers build computer systems with formal, fine-grained, application-specific information security guarantees.

Abstract: There is an increasing trend towards federated distributed systems, i.e., systems that are operated jointly by multiple different organizations or individuals. The interests of the participants in such a system are often highly diverse and/or in conflict with one another; for example, participants may be business competitors or based in hostile nations. Thus, federated systems are inherently vulnerable to insider attacks: the participants can try to subvert the system, exploit it for their own benefit, or attack other participants.<br/><br/>However, the participants in a federated system are typically connected in the 'offline world' as well, e.g., through social networks or business relationships. This context can be leveraged to handle misbehavior through well-known, time-tested techniques like accountability and transparency. For example, if one participant can detect and prove that another participant has misbehaved, she can sue that participant for breach of contract.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop a key technology for enabling this approach, namely a reliable and general way to generate and verify evidence of misbehavior in federated systems. The project (i) studies the fundamental tradeoffs, requirements, and inherent costs of creating evidence; (ii) develops new algorithms for efficiently supporting different kinds of evidence; and (iii) evaluates these algorithms in the context of practical systems.<br/><br/>The project is integrated with Penn's new undergraduate program in Market and Social Systems Engineering. It will produce and freely distribute software that can be used to defend federated systems against attacks and malicious insiders.

Abstract: The security architecture of consumer operating systems is currently undergoing a fundamental change. In platforms such as Android, iOS, and Windows 8, each application is a separate security principal that can own data. While this distinction is a vast improvement over traditional user-focused security architectures, sharing data between applications results in an unexpected loss of control of that data, potentially exposing security and privacy sensitive information. This research improves the security of these modern consumer operating systems by providing a holistic view of data protection. In particular, this work proposes a new operating system abstraction for transparently tracking and controlling access to all data, allowing policy to determine if a reader is given the true value, a fake or modified value, or no value at all. To efficiently and practically accomplish this goal, this work combines several existing and new techniques to track and control access to data. The new abstraction provided by this work not only solves a significant problem affecting modern consumer operating systems by enabling applications to retain pervasive control over their data, but also more broadly provides a new abstraction on which a variety of new security solutions can be built.

Abstract: The security of pervasive computing devices relies on cryptographic engines which are usually considered the most trusted part of the system. An immanent threat to embedded cryptographic engines are physical attacks. Practical countermeasures against physical attacks are not completely fail-safe and overly expensive for most applications. Theoretical approaches, however, still tend to have imperfect leakage models and wrong or impractical assumptions about the abilities of cryptographic sub-primitives. Yet, the theoretical concepts of leakage resilience, which have been mostly disregarded by practitioners, carry a great potential to construct cryptographic primitives that resist physical attacks and allow for more resource-efficient implementations.<br/><br/>The project investigates solutions for basic cryptographic services that are (i) secure in the presence of physical attacks and (ii) are comparable in performance and costs to state-of-the-art implementations of cryptography. This is achieved by enhancing the concepts of leakage resilience to make them applicable in the constrained regimes of embedded pervasive systems. Theoretical concepts are advanced and brought into practice by actual implementation. Practical evaluation uncovers remaining weaknesses in the currently used leakage models. By combining the advantages of both approaches ? a thorough practical evaluation of the applied methods and the well-defined leakage-resilience of the theoretical approaches ? stronger, more reliable, and practical solutions are derived. Besides an increased security for the wide range of embedded products, the findings give valuable feedback to both theoretic cryptographers and practical security architects. <br/><br/>Only security solutions that are leakage resilient, withstand practical evaluation and match economic expectations guarantee a widespread use and hence more secure pervasive systems.

Abstract: This project aims to create a systematic framework with novel approaches and techniques to defend against current and next generation botnets. A botnet is a network of compromised computers (bots) that are under the control of an attacker (botmaster) through some command & control (C&C) channel. In recent years, botnets have distinguished themselves from previous generation malware as the primary platform and root-cause for most Internet attacks and illegal activities. With the magnitude and the potency of attacks afforded by their combined bandwidth and processing power, botnets are now considered as the greatest single threat to Internet security. As botnets involve both host-level and network-level activities, a systematic defensive framework should consider both host- and network-level information. We can achieve better defense by utilizing host-network coordination, community-based intelligence, and a cross-layer view, instead of relying on a single (or a set of separate) host- or network-level information source(s). <br/><br/>This project establishes a host-network coordination- and correlation-based framework for systematic botnet defense in depth. It addresses three major questions covering detection, prevention, and attribution of botnets: How to detect the existence of botnets in an efficient, accurate, robust, fast, and automatic way? How to prevent botnets from penetrating into a protected network? Where does the command and control (C&C) actually originate from? The methodology and techniques proposed in the project can have a profound impact on future malware defense in terms of improving its effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness.

Abstract: This project develops methods to provide citizens information about technologies that obstruct, restrict, or tamper with their access to information. Internet users need an objective, independent, third-party service that helps them determine whether their Internet service provider or government is restricting access to content, specific protocols, or otherwise degrading service. Towards this goal, we are (1) monitoring attempts to block or manipulate Internet content and communications; and (2) evaluating various censorship circumvention mechanisms in real-world deployments}. The project develops a large-scale measurement and monitoring service that measures network reachability and performance from a variety of access networks to various Internet services; infers whether ISPs or governments are restricting or otherwise throttling access to various applications and services; and detects attempts to tamper with information presented to users. The project also studyies the policy ramifications of making information about censorship and information tampering available to Internet users. It will provide up-to-date information about both the extent of censorship and information tampering in countries around the world and technologies countries are using to implement censorship and thwart censorship circumvention tools. Discoveries are disseminated through real-time portals and through regular written reports and academic publications.

Abstract: Personal healthcare systems based on wearable/implantable medical devices are being increasingly deployed for a variety of diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic applications. A consequence of the increased functional complexity, software programmability, and wireless network connectivity of such devices is that they are now vulnerable to security attacks that have plagued general-purpose computing systems. Recent demonstration of security attacks on commercially deployed systems has raised medical device security concerns significantly. Unfortunately, medical devices come with extreme size/power constraints and unique usage models, making it infeasible to simply borrow conventional security solutions.<br/><br/>This research focuses on developing a non-intrusive medical security monitor that snoops on all wireless communication to/from medical devices and uses multi-layered anomaly detection to identify potentially malicious transactions. While formal methods have been previously used to check for implementation flaws, they are not geared towards verifying the safety behavior of the medical device software in its interactions with the real world, which can expose logical flaws as well. The work investigates these interactions by transforming properties specified at the real-world interfaces (sensors and actuators) into program properties against which the medical device software can be verified. The findings will be disseminated through conferences and journals. The hardware and software developed will be placed in the public domain, and disseminated to the industry. The knowledge developed will be integrated into various courses. Undergraduates will be encouraged to perform independent research on this topic. Fellowships and outreach programs will be leveraged to encourage participation of female and minority students.

Abstract: One of the most severe and challenging threats to Internet security and privacy is phishing, which uses fake websites to steal users' online identities and sensitive information. Existing studies have evaluated younger users' susceptibility to phishing attacks, but have not paid sufficient attention to elderly users' susceptibility to phishing in realistic environments. As the elderly population in the United States and the world continues to grow rapidly, the elderly Internet user population also continues to grow, and seniors have become very attractive targets for online fraud. <br/><br/>Traditional forms of phishing have been prevalent for over a decade; in contrast, web single sign-on phishing is a more modern strategy, with unique characteristics that make it more profitable, insidious, and harder to detect than traditional phishing. The goal of this project is to systematically compare younger and older computer users' susceptibility to both the traditional and the newly emergent web single sign-on phishing. We build a comprehensive computer testbed that measures phishing susceptibility in a realistic environment. We hypothesize that older adults will differ from younger adults in terms of their susceptibility to both types of phishing, and that this susceptibility can be explained by differences in cognitive abilities, specifically executive functioning and decision-making skills. <br/><br/>The results of this project will advance our knowledge on how and why elderly users may fall victim to phishing, and will provide a solid basis for researchers to further design effective mechanisms to protect elderly users against phishing from both technical and cognitive perspectives.

Abstract: The Internet is one of the primary communication media for users who are visually impaired. However, the vulnerability of this underserved population of Internet users to various forms of cyber-attacks has deteriorated the effective use of online services offered for general Internet users. The screen reader tools often overwhelm users with visual disability by providing large amounts of text, which may lead those users to ignore that information. An ignored security warning may harm users and make them vulnerable to various forms of cyber-threats. This project translates security cues and warnings into various forms of tones and sounds through sonification. It takes a security cue or warning message and composes the most effective pitch/sound to represent the security warning and conveys the security information to the users who are visually impaired through sounds instead of text verbalized by screen readers. The sonified security warnings undergo extensive usability testing in order to assess the effectiveness of the sonified security cues. The broader impact of this sonification project includes providing a sonification-based technology to alert Internet users who are visually impaired and assist them to make an informed decision when encountering security warnings and to ensure that those security warnings are not overlooked. The sonification-based technology for transforming security warnings to sounds can be integrated to any popular Internet Web browser.

Abstract: A new, emergent cybersecurity frontier is information manipulation, whereby adversaries may attempt to distort information to influence opinion, thought, or action. Information manipulation can take many shapes and forms, from blatant attacks such as search-poisoning, misinformation such as bogus on-line reviews, to subtle distortion such as personalized search and biased news. Left unchecked, information manipulation can harm our economy, culture, and democracy. Past research efforts have been ad-hoc and focused on specific kinds of information manipulation. <br/><br/>This work aims to lay the foundations of research in information manipulation. There are three research components: (1) surveying the long line of relevant scholarly work on information manipulation, and investigating how the established types of manipulation play out on the Internet and if the Internet gives rise to novel types of manipulation, (2) generating an overarching conceptual framework about information manipulation to capture the basic properties of various forms of existing and possible manipulation practices on the Internet, and (3) developing taxonomy of information manipulation that facilitates the development of general countermeasure for each category of manipulation. This project is tightly integrated with social-science research. In particular, political and social behavioral study identifies the important insights from at least two millennia of scholarship on information manipulation and help define models of the actors, goals, mechanisms, and strategies of information manipulation in the Internet era. The historical perspectives and conceptualization of information manipulation provide the foundation for developing a comprehensive framework to counter information manipulation.

Abstract: We are evaluating a new model of password security in which users place pieces on a game board (e.g., chess pieces on a chessboard). The fact that existing systems are either memorable or secure, but not both, motivated our approach. We are testing 14-15 year old high school students, college students 18-30, and older adults 60-80, and we are conducting two types of experiments. First, we are measuring all groups' memories for passwords of two and four game pieces (after a 20-minute filled delay). Second, we are testing college students' memories for five different passwords over a 12-week period in which the game changes after week 10. The results are expected to reveal a dramatically better authentication method compared to existing systems. More specifically, participants are expected to create unique passwords that they can remember. Furthermore, performance is expected to decline during the first 10 weeks, as their passwords begin to interfere with one another, and increase dramatically during the final two weeks, once the game changes and they are able to use a new type of memory. We will present the results at social science and computer security conferences, and submit for publication to sociology, psychology, and security journals. Our approach offers a radical breakthrough that is mathematically secure and easy to remember. The model is applicable to a wide range of electronic platforms, including smartphones, computers, ATMs, and other high-risk electronic gateways. Consequently, the potential to benefit society with more secure systems should have an enormous impact.

Abstract: Digital storage media failure is a common occurrence, but an understanding of the mechanisms for the failure can be elusive and have far reaching implications. This project utilizes a digital laser microscope to investigate the impact of physical and environmental manipulation of digital storage media on failure rates and data recoverability. This investigation into the physical characteristics of digital media is establishing failure thresholds and their suitability for data recovery. The results of the project are being stored in a taxonomy of digital media failure characteristics, potential data recovery techniques, and microscopic image maps of the media failures and interventions. An additional aspect of the project is an extensive outreach component, which includes the K-12 and community college environments. Further impacts of this investigation include the ability to utilize physical media manipulation as a security mechanism, as well as improve digital media reliability.

Abstract: Many recent security attacks are financially motivated. Understanding how attackers monetize their activities is critical to combine technological, legal, and economic intervention to render certain classes of attacks unprofitable, and disincentivize miscreants from considering them.<br/><br/>Manipulation of social network and web search-engine results to promote illicit businesses is increasingly common. Rather than the product of isolated attackers, search-engine manipulation relies on collaboration between many distinct actors, ranging from individuals installing malware on end-systems, to miscreants funneling traffic in exchange for commissions on sales.<br/><br/>This project aims to quantitatively model the economic interactions between the actors behind search-engine manipulation, and to infer which intervention policies could raise the cost of carrying out these attacks. <br/><br/>We develop novel measurement methodologies to collect large amounts of field data, cross-reference our measurements with data from industry partners, and gather forensic evidence on compromised hosts that are unknowingly participating in attacks. This leads us to quantify various operational parameters (e.g., common malware families, common infrastructure components...), and use them to build economic models of search-engine manipulation attacks. <br/><br/>Project outcomes include (1) identifying salient features that denote relationships between different entities participating in search-engine manipulation campaigns, (2) describing possible relationships between different types of illicit online trades, and (3) discovering points of failure in the attackers' infrastructure, that the defenders can try to exploit. More generally, this study will further refine our understanding of online crime economics, which will not only be useful to security researchers, but also to economists and criminologists.

Abstract: The goal of our work is to (a) capture people's expectations and surprises in using mobile apps in a scalable manner, and to (b) summarize these perceptions in a simple format to help people make better trust decisions. Our main idea is analyzing privacy in the form of people's expectations about what an app will and won't do, focusing on where an app breaks people's expectations. We are building an App Scanner that combines automated scanning techniques with crowdsourcing. Automated scanning captures the behavior of an app, while crowdsourcing is used to interpret how expected and acceptable this behavior is. This information is used as the basis for building a better privacy summary for apps. We have organized an interdisciplinary team with expertise in mobile computing, computer security, systems, and human-computer interaction.<br/><br/>Success in this work will include results in: (a) the design and implementation of an App Scanner that combines automated techniques with crowdsourcing techniques for analyzing and interpreting privacy-related behaviors of mobile apps; (b) a series of evaluations of this app scanner, showing effectiveness, accuracy, and scalability; (c) the design and evaluation of better privacy summaries, which prioritize and highlight the most unexpected behaviors of an app; and (d) demonstration of a new conceptualization of privacy, namely privacy as expectations. Success will also help end-users, corporate and government employees manage their privacy better than can be done today.

Abstract: Internet users may have compelling reasons to seek anonymity online, for example, to discuss stigmatizing issues with others like themselves, or to express dissident opinions. This project studies what people believe it means to be anonymous online, how their privacy and security are affected by their strategies to achieve anonymity, and how they are likely to use new anonymity services. These questions are important because the traceability of users? actions across sites and contexts is ever greater, increasing risks for users who may misjudge their actual anonymity. <br/>The research involves interviews, surveys, and experimental studies to identify user motivations and practices, situational factors, and individual differences that lead people to desire anonymity. The research investigates the risks that users? perceive in their interactions, their motivations to avoid being identified, and the strategies they employ to mitigate risks they perceive to themselves and their relationships. A key component of this work is identifying cross-national and cultural differences in anonymity motivations and actions of people in countries such as China, where the government monitors and blocks Internet communications. This information will be used to design instructional materials and other tools that provide users with feedback and better strategies to protect themselves against risk. This project will inform cyberspace technical design and policy by addressing the SaTC goals of understanding, predicting and explaining prevention, attack, and defense behaviors and contributing to strategies for remediation.

Abstract: The evolution of data storage in modern operating systems (OSes) brings challenges for fine-grained data protection. While traditional OSes offer simple, relatively low-level data abstractions -- files and directories -- modern operating systems, including Android and iOS, embed much higher-level abstractions, such as relational databases and object-relational models. The new abstractions complicate file structures and access patterns, greatly challenging existing protection systems, such as encrypted file systems, deniable file systems, antiviruses, and anomaly detectors, which, fallen behind the times, continue to operate at file level.<br/><br/>In this project, we are investigating new data protection abstractions that are better attuned to modern OSes. One example is a logical data object (LDO). An LDO corresponds to an application-specific resource -- such as an email, a document, or a bank account -- and includes all the data related to it, no matter how or where it is persisted (e.g., rows in databases, objects in object-relational models, files in the file system, etc.). Protection systems use LDOs to acquire rich semantics about the data to refine their effectiveness. Using LDOs, we are building HideIt, a fine-grained object hiding system that lets users select, through the familiar UIs of their unmodified applications, arbitrary objects -- such as individual emails, documents, bank accounts -- and hide or unhide them. By creating new, convenient protection abstractions, and teaching students and the broader community about them, we hope to promote a responsible approach to data management, in which users manage their data carefully, minimizing its exposure to attacks.

Abstract: This project explores the extent to which personality traits predict privacy and security behaviors. Over the past decade, computer privacy and security have improved by leaps and bounds by considering human factors in the design process. However, previous work to improve the usability of privacy and security systems has only examined the behaviors of "average users," which is believed to only yield local maxima because no individual perfectly fits this profile. Therefore, this project is examining the extent to which additional improvements can be made by catering system designs to individual differences (e.g., in personality traits). Through a series of surveys and controlled experiments, researchers are discovering how these personality traits are predictive of certain privacy decisions, as well as interactions with various security mitigations. For instance, knowledge of a user's personality traits may result in more appropriate default privacy settings on a social networking website or web browser security warnings that are more salient to that user. The researchers' goal is to ultimately design systems that infer personality traits and then adjust privacy and security mechanisms so as to yield outcomes that are optimally aligned with a particular user's preferences.

Abstract: Attackers only need to find a single exploitable bug in order to<br/>install malware, bots, and viruses on a vulnerable user's computer.<br/>Unfortunately, bugs are plentiful. For example, the Ubuntu Linux<br/>distribution bug management database currently lists over 58,000 open<br/>bugs. Thus, the question is not whether an attacker can find a bug,<br/>but which bugs an attacker can exploit.<br/><br/>This research investigates novel techniques, approaches, and<br/>algorithms for finding exploitable bugs. The ability to deterimine<br/>whether a bug is exploitable or not will allow developers to<br/>prioritize bug reports so that the most security-critical bugs are<br/>fixed first. The techniques investigated will also help developers<br/>distribute patches safely.

Abstract: The project explores the influence that offline cues and stimuli, indicating the presence of other human beings in the physical world, and often processed unconsciously by our brains, can have over security and privacy behavior in cyberspace. <br/><br/>The project is predicated around an evolutionary conjecture: Human beings have evolved to detect and react to threats in their physical environment, and have developed perceptual systems selected to assess these ?physical? stimuli for current, material risks. In cyberspace, the same stimuli often are absent, subdued, or intentionally manipulated by third parties. Hence, security and privacy concerns that would normally be activated in the offline world are restrained, and defense behaviors are hampered.<br/><br/>While it is impossible to test such conjecture directly, indirect evidence compatible with the conjecture can be obtained by investigating the impact that external stimuli in the physical world have on security and privacy behavior in cyberspace. The proposed research consists in a stream of human subjects controlled experiments investigating such impact of various sets of stimuli or cues. <br/><br/>This significance of this research is two-fold. First, it attempts to advance the scientific understanding of what makes security and privacy decision making in cyberspace uniquely different from, and sometimes more difficult than security and privacy in the physical world. Second, by investigating a factor that may significantly disrupt user behavior in cyberspace, the research findings could inspire the construction of systems that induce more secure behavior.

Abstract: Continual advances in wireless communication technology offer additional protections against interference and jamming, but these same advances unfortunately also enable stronger attacks. Observant attackers can achieve significant gains by incorporating knowledge of the network under attack, and jammers can consider various metrics, including attack impact, energy efficiency, and stealth. Moreover, attackers can continually adapt parameters and behaviors to compensate for system dynamics, thwart detection, and save valuable resources. Robust wireless communication protocols that can survive such adaptive attacks require new techniques for near-real-time defensive adaptation, allowing the defenders to similarly modify their parameters in response to perceived attack impacts.<br/><br/>This project will involve the three primary tasks of identifying and modeling advanced inference-based jamming attacks, developing novel cross-layer network defenses to mitigate jamming attacks using similar adapatation techniques, and characterizing system-level behaviors that emerge from the interactions between multiple adapting parties. Contributions of the project will expand the existing body of knowledge in wireless network security by developing novel probabilistic, game theoretic, and control system theoretic models to better understand efficient and stealthy jamming attacks and provide a basis for future robust protocol design. Application areas in which the project work will be included are mobile commerce using NFC, home networking, medical information management, smart grid communication, and disaster response.

Abstract: The security of our software is critical for consumer confidence, the protection of privacy and valuable intellectual property, and of course national security. Because of our society's increased reliance on software, security breaches can lead to serious personal or corporate losses, and endanger the privacy, liberties, and even the lives of individuals. As threats to software security have become more sophisticated, so too have the techniques and analyses developed to improve it. Symbolic execution has emerged as a fundamental tool for security applications. Its main idea is to run a program using symbolic instead of concrete values: a set of symbols are assigned to the program inputs, and the outputs are expressed as a set of "verification conditions", logical formulas over the input symbols. A number of successful security analyses use symbolic execution and similar methods to recast security questions about programs as constraint satisfaction problems in some formal logic. Automatic reasoners for that logic can then be used to solve those problems. In the last few years, solvers based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) techniques have become a natural choice in such approaches to security because of their superior performance and automation compared to more traditional theorem provers and their greater generality with respect to ad-hoc tools or propositional satisfiability solvers.<br/><br/>This collaborative project brings together experts in security and in SMT to pursue two complementary research goals: (i) harness the full power of SMT solvers to improve current security tools based on symbolic analysis; and (ii) design and develop new techniques to address the needs of anticipated future security applications. Specific activities addressing these goals include: collecting challenge benchmark problems from existing security analyses and developing targeted SMT optimizations for these benchmarks; developing appropriate security abstractions in the SMT language used to express security verification conditions; developing logical theories and algorithms for reasoning about character strings in such verification conditions; exposing a general framework for extending the verification condition language; and developing techniques for computing symbolic solution sets for SMT constraints. These activities are expected to (i) significantly increase the flexibility, performance, and reasoning capabilities of SMT solvers in support of security applications; (ii) improve the performance and scalability of current security analyses by leveraging the reasoning power of SMT solvers; and (iii) provide a foundation for new, more powerful, and more expressive security analyses. Overall, this project will help create more scalable and expressive security applications which could have a considerable impact on society as they enable the production of software much more resistant to security attacks.

Abstract: Past research investigating the human side of cybersecurity has treated people as isolated individuals rather than as social actors acting within a web of relationships and social influence. We are investigating how social influence can and does affect cybersecurity. More specifically, we are studying how people learn about new security behaviors from their social network, using both qualitative and quantitative methods.<br/><br/>We are also developing and evaluating novel techniques for leveraging social influences to improve people?s awareness and knowledge of cybersecurity, as well as motivation to act securely. These techniques make use of established principles from social psychology for influencing people, specifically similarity and social norms. We are applying these same ideas towards influencing people?s attitudes and behaviors towards cybersecurity.<br/><br/>Success in this work will open up a new dimension to cybersecurity and add to the toolbox for researchers and practitioners, in terms of applying known ideas from an established field in a new context to improve cybersecurity. Our work will also improve the community?s understanding of how people learn their cybersecurity behaviors (of which currently there is little literature), and will lead to a rigorous evaluation of how effective two different social mechanisms are in influencing people?s awareness, knowledge, and motivations towards acting more securely online.

Abstract: Brookdale Community College (BCC) is designing, implementing, and evaluating an innovative pathway from cyber talent to cyber workforce. It includes a unique public-private partnership that leverages the agility of community colleges and the course material of the SANS Institute to develop a scalable, competition-driven, hands-on education model that has a potential to help with the nation's critical shortage of cybersecurity workforce. The project designs metrics to identify individuals with the appropriate aptitude and expose them to vital, in-depth, hands-on learning model focusing on defending computer systems and networks. The project utilizes a multiphase competition-based model and, at each stage, students compete to demonstrate their competence and to advance to the next phase of the program. Students who successfully complete all components of the program and demonstrate their mastery have the opportunity to apply for residency positions where they can hone their skills working with practicing security professionals on real-world projects. The proposed competition and residency based model for developing the cybersecurity technical talent has a real potential for dissemination and implementation in a large number of the 1,200 community colleges nationwide.

Abstract: A defining characteristic of modern personal computing is the trend towards extensible platforms (e.g., smartphones and tablets) that run a large number of specialized applications, many of uncertain quality or provenance. The common security mechanisms available on these platforms are application isolation and permission systems. Unfortunately, it has been repeatedly shown that these mechanisms fail to prevent a range of misbehaviors, including privilege-escalation attacks and information-flow leakage. Researchers have proposed information-flow protections for these platforms. However, such mechanisms have rarely been adopted in practice, partly due to the level of abstraction at which they allow policies to be specified.<br/><br/>We develop a formal, case-study-driven approach that will leverage advances in information-flow research to develop new policy-specification languages and enforcement mechanisms for today's extensible environments. First, we develop appropriate policy-specification languages that allow policies to be specified at an intermediate level of abstraction. Policy specification will be easy enough to understand and formulate to be accessible to most developers, yet sufficiently expressive to support rich policies. Second, we develop hybrid enforcement mechanisms to support policy that is specified at levels of abstraction that do not neatly overlap isolation boundaries provided by the platform. Third, the correctness of the mechanisms will be supported by formal models and proofs. To remain grounded and ensure practical relevance, we focus our work on two application domains: the Android operating system, and, secondarily, the Chromium web browser.

Abstract: Natural language privacy policies have become a de facto standard to address expectations of notice and choice on the Web. Yet, there is ample evidence that users generally do not read these policies and that those who occasionally do struggle to understand what they read. Initiatives aimed at addressing this problem through the development of machine implementable standards or other solutions that require website operators to adhere to more stringent requirements have run into obstacles, with many website operators showing reluctance to commit to anything more than what they currently do. This project offers the prospect of overcoming the limitations of current natural language privacy policies without imposing new requirements on website operators.<br/><br/>This frontier project builds on recent advances in natural language processing, privacy preference modeling, crowdsourcing, formal methods, and privacy interfaces to overcome this situation. It combines fundamental research with the development of scalable technologies to semi-automatically extract key privacy policy features from natural language website privacy policies and present these features to users in an easy-to-digest format that enables them to make more informed privacy decisions as they interact with different websites. Work in this project also involves the systematic collection and analysis of website privacy policies, looking for trends and deficiencies both in the wording and content of these policies across different sectors and using this analysis to inform ongoing public policy debates. An important part of this project is to work closely with stake holders in industry to enable the transfer of these technologies to industry for large-scale deployment.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) encompass a large variety of systems including for example future energy systems (e.g. smart grid), homeland security and emergency response, smart medical technologies, smart cars and air transportation. One of the most important challenges in the design and deployment of Cyber-Physical Systems is how to formally guarantee that they are amenable to effective human control. This is a challenging problem not only because of the operational changes and increasing complexity of future CPS but also because of the nonlinear nature of the human-CPS system under realistic assumptions. Current state of the art has in general produced simplified models and has not fully considered realistic assumptions about system and environmental constraints or human cognitive abilities and limitations. To overcome current state of the art limitations, our overall research goal is to develop a theoretical framework for complex human-CPS that enables formal analysis and verification to ensure stability of the overall system operation as well as avoidance of unsafe operating states. To analyze a human-CPS involving a human operator(s) with bounded rationality three key questions are identified: (a) Are the inputs available to the operator sufficient to generate desirable behaviors for the CPS? (b) If so, how easy is it for the operator with her cognitive limitations to drive the system towards a desired behavior? (c) How can areas of poor system performance and determine appropriate mitigations be formally identified? The overall technical approach will be to (a) develop and appropriately leverage general cognitive models that incorporate human limitations and capabilities, (b) develop methods to abstract cognitive models to yield tractable analytical human models (c) develop innovative techniques to design the abstract interface between the human and underlying system to reflect mutual constraints, and (d) extend current state-of-the-art reachability and verification algorithms for analysis of abstract interfaces, iin which one of the systems in the feedback loop (i.e., the user) is mostly unknown, uncertain, highly variable or poorly modeled.<br/><br/>The research will provide contributions with broad significance in the following areas: (1) fundamental principles and algorithms that would serve as a foundation for provably safe robust hybrid control systems for mixed human-CPS (2) methods for the development of analytical human models that incorporate cognitive abilities and limitations and their consequences in human control of CPS, (3) validated techniques for interface design that enables effective human situation awareness through an interface that ensures minimum information necessary for the human to safely control the CPS, (4) new reachability analysis techniques that are scalable and allow rapid determination of different levels of system safety. The research will help to identify problems (such as automation surprises, inadequate or excessive information contained in the user interface) in safety critical, high-risk, or expensive CPS before they are built, tested and deployed. The research will provide the formal foundations for understanding and developing human-CPS and will have a broad range of applications in the domains of healthcare, energy, air traffic control, transportation systems, homeland security and large-scale emergency response. The research will contribute to the advancement of under-represented students in STEM fields through educational innovation and outreach. The code, benchmarks and data will be released via the project website.<br/><br/>Formal descriptions of models of human cognition are in general incompatible with formal models of the Cyber Physical System (CPS) the human operator(s) control. Therefore, it is difficult to determine in a rigorous way whether a CPS controlled by a human operator will be safe or stable and under which circumstances. The objective of this research is to develop an analytic framework of human-CPS systems that encompasses engineering compatible formal models of the human operator that preserve the basic architectural features of human cognition. In this project the team will develop methodologies for building such models as well as techniques for formal verification of the human-CPS system so that performance guarantees can be provided. They will validate models in a variety of domains ranging from air traffic control to large scale emergency response to the administration of anesthesia.

Abstract: Computer users can be distinguished from one another based on differences in their typing rhythms. Our research extends this idea to ask whether a user's level of anxiety or stress can also be determined, but based on *changes* in typing rhythms. Thus, our primary research objective is to answer a single scientific question in a laboratory study: Do typing rhythms change when a typist is under stress, such that the change can be measured and detected with a standard keyboard?<br/><br/>Why would anyone want to do this? There are at least two reasons: (1) people under stress tend to make more errors at the keyboard/console, which can affect job accuracy and reliability; and (2) insiders who abuse their legitimate access to sensitive computer systems are likely to show signs of stress in the execution of a nefarious act, such as cyber espionage. In each of these examples, remote detection of typist stress, through the use of the common keyboard, would alert supervisory personnel to a potential problem that could be averted.<br/><br/>In addition to having a major effect on error prevention in national critical infrastructure controls, and on insider detection in cyber space, the impact of this research in health care could also be substantial. For example, subtle changes in typing rhythms could indicate early onset dementia, episodes of cognitive decline, or even a tendency for musculoskeletal disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome or digital flexor tendinitis.<br/><br/>As this research develops, so will the range of beneficial uses.

Abstract: Information sharing between operators (agents) in critical infrastructure systems such as the Smart Grid is fundamental to reliable and sustained operation. The contention, however, between sharing data for system stability and reliability (utility) and withholding data for competitive advantage (privacy) has stymied data sharing in such systems, sometimes with catastrophic consequences. This motivates a data sharing framework that addresses the competitive interests and information leakage concerns of agents and enables timely and controlled information exchange.<br/><br/>This research develops a foundational approach to privacy-guaranteed information sharing among distributed self-interested agents in complex systems using information theory and game theory. This multidisciplinary project focuses on four mutually related challenges in multi-agent network abstractions of the Smart Grid: (1) characterization of the fundamental limits of distributed interaction with privacy constraints; (2) operational and practical significance of information-theoretic privacy measures; (3) formalizing the cost of privacy and the role of trust and repeated interactions for cooperation; and a direct application of these results via (4) distributed algorithms and protocols for privacy-guaranteed data sharing in the Smart Grid. The research has the broader implication of enabling information sharing in a variety of complex networks with strict privacy requirements including electronic healthcare and water distribution systems, and also engenders academic and industry collaborations in power systems. This research project incorporates carefully tailored outreach efforts including privacy awareness for middle- and high-school students, and active engagement of undergraduate and graduate students, especially females, in research.

Abstract: Making the ``right'' privacy decision --- that is, balancing revelation and protection of personal information in ways that maximize a user's welfare --- is difficult. The complexity is such that our judgments in this area are prone to errors, leading to decisions that we may later stand to regret. These errors stem from lack of information or computational ability; but also from problems of self-control and limited self-insight. Our research focuses on designing and testing systems that anticipate and counter cognitive and behavioral biases that hamper users' privacy (as well as security) decision making. Our approach is informed by the growing body of behavioral economics research on ?soft,? or asymmetric, paternalism, as well as by research in behavioral decision research and usability. Inspired by these streams of research, we design and study systems that ``nudge'' users towards certain privacy or security behaviors ? which the users themselves have stated to prefer, or which empirical evidence has demonstrated to be beneficial. Helping users avoid mistakes, decrease regret, and achieve more rapidly the desired balance between sharing and protecting personal information has clear, and significant, societal importance. However, our research will also inform the work of privacy (and security) technologists and policy makers by advancing our understanding of what makes privacy decision making difficult, and how to counter biases that adversely affect privacy- and security-sensitive behavior.

Abstract: Organizations, such as hospitals, financial institutions, and universities, that collect and use personal information are required to comply with privacy regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Similarly, to ensure customer trust, web services companies, such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo!, and Amazon, publish privacy policies stating what they will do with the information they keep about customers' individual behaviors. These policies impose constraints on disclosure (or transmission) of personal information, articulate obligations (e.g., notifying customers about privacy breaches), and identify purposes for which personal information may or may not be used. Prior work has focused on formalisms for disclosure and obligations, but no such foundation has been developed for information use for specified purposes.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. This project addresses the central problem of developing a formal semantics that explains what it means to use information for a set of purposes, a logic for specifying such policies, and algorithmic methods for their enforcement. It advances the state of knowledge in the field of privacy by providing a foundation for a concept that is commonly used in practice, but has not been the subject of careful scientific study. The project also investigates the interaction of this concept with the previously studied concepts of disclosure and obligation, thereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of privacy. The formal semantics the project develops is novel and draws on insights from prior work on philosophical theories of causation and intentions, and from the computer science literature on formal methods, information flow, and planning. The model is validated through user studies and its application through case studies in the healthcare domain. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. The project addresses a problem of significant and growing importance to society. It initiates a new direction in providing foundations for privacy by studying the concept of information use for a purpose. This concept appears in privacy policies published by organizations in sectors as diverse as finance, web services, healthcare, insurance, education, and government - the cornerstones of modern society. The semantic foundation serves as the basis for developing practical tools to support the enforcement of such policies in such organizations. The project provides opportunities for engaging graduate and undergraduate students. The PIs plan to integrate the research results into their existing security and privacy courses, and, for wider dissemination, leverage outreach programs in Carnegie Mellon's Computer Science Department and CyLab aimed at K-12, women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities.

Abstract: Numerous technical and environmental forces are increasing the importance of data privacy for businesses and individuals alike. These forces include the migration of data to Web services, the permanent archiving of large volumes of data and communications by services and ISPs, and legal actions that are forcing individuals and organizations to reveal private (and even encrypted) data. Traditional encryption is an insufficient solution under these conditions, thereby creating new challenges to preserving our digital privacy in an increasingly inter-connected and digital world. This project tackles these challenges through the creation of a principled framework for protecting the privacy of past data -- such as copies of emails maintained by an email provider -- against accidental, malicious, and legal disclosure, even to entities who have access to the decryption keys. This framework consists of both underlying technical mechanisms and prototype applications; these mechanisms and prototype applications are developed in concert to ensure the broadest applicability of the overall framework. These prototype applications, by themselves, also directly address the privacy needs of broad classes of individuals, ranging from home users wishing to enhance the privacy of their email communications to voting machine manufacturers wishing to improve the privacy of electronic voting audit logs.

Abstract: This research is building an understanding of what data is useful to attackers and what data is private for its legitimate owners so that security systems can incorporate these values into a data-driven, defense-in-depth approach to securing our digital lives.<br/><br/>We are exploiting the fact that both users and attackers must sift through vast amounts of data to find useful information. This system, called contextual data protection, enables users to passively manage their private and potentially lucrative stored data with minimal overhead, adding extra protection to private data which greatly lowers the risk inherent in long lived archives.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, we are creating effective defenses for data by improving our understanding of cybercrime, information use habits, and acceptable usability tradeoffs for data access. Building on previous research analyzing the financial successes of spam-based cybercrime, we are developing a methodology and apparatus for understanding the illicit value of stolen information. By understanding what is discoverable and valuable to attackers, we can develop techniques to focus security efforts on lucrative information, thereby preventing cybercriminals from turning a profit.<br/><br/>Ultimately, our goal is to create a set of general techniques that use tools from cryptography that defend users' data by exploiting a deeper understanding of its value to both the users and the attackers. This research will shed light on the meaning of information value, ownership, and protection in this era of long-lived digital storage.

Abstract: Consider a network where each node is either good or bad. The good nodes all run an algorithm that attempts to achieve a specific goal. The hidden set of bad nodes are controlled by an adversary who uses them to thwart this goal.<br/><br/>Informally, cost-competitive analysis considers the resource cost of each good node as a function of the total resource cost of the adversary. The goal is to design algorithms that achieve their objectives, while minimizing this cost. Critically, when bad nodes suffer higher costs than good nodes, it is expected that they will eventually cease their attack, as their resources become depleted.<br/><br/>Goals of this project are to design cost-competitive algorithms for: communication in wireless networks; tolerating distributed denial-of-service attacks; secure routing in peer-to-peer networks; and enabling nodes to come to agreement.<br/><br/>Cost-competitive analysis offers a novel approach for making progress on challenging attacks that cannot be adequately addressed in models that ignore the costs of the attacker. By adopting a more realistic attack model, this approach more accurately quantifies the limits of efficient attack resistance. It is thus expected that a cost-competitive approach will yield more compelling solutions to security challenges in many domains. In particular, this project may have high impact in security challenges involving open environments such as: wireless sensor networks, overlays, reputation systems; and aspects of contemporary problems in industry such as: public cloud computing, reliable versions of MapReduce, and robust distributed lock managers like Google's Chubby lock service.

Abstract: The Wireless Philadelphia Network (WPN) is a metropolitan?area network (MAN) consisting of thousands of Tropos 5210 wireless mesh routers distributed across the entire city of Philadelphia and connected by a fiber backbone. This project is employing this network as a testbed to investigate three diverse security challenges facing any large-scale wireless network servicing a heterogeneous population. The first challenge is in efficient network anomaly detection algorithms, and the proposed solution is to investigate the efficacy of both compressive sampling and distributed source coding based approaches in reducing the amount of data that must be transmitted to the anomaly detector. The second challenge is physical layer security in wireless networks, and the proposed solution is to use physical layer based encryption algorithms and user authentication. The third challenge is anomaly detection at the application layer, in particular for web servers, and the proposed solution is to develop software sensors on the hardware, operating system, virtual machine, and application server, and develop rules for identifying possible anomalies using these metrics. Besides the intellectual merit of these challenges, the project has several broader impacts. First, low-income residents gain Internet access through integration with the Freedom Rings Partnership. Second, students participate in community service based engineering design projects. Finally, curricular enhancements and the recruitment of women and minority graduate students improve the educational and diversity missions at our university.

Abstract: Increasing amounts of data are being collected about users, and increasingly sophisticated analytics are being applied to this data for various purposes. Privacy analytics are machine learning and data mining algorithms applied by end-users to their data for the purpose of helping them manage both private information and their self-presentation. This research develops privacy analytics that help users answer three interconnected questions about their online persona (1) What data does the user consider sensitive, and in what contexts should one share it?; (2) What does the data say about the user; and (3) Who knows what? These privacy analytics introduce a novel, inverse data mining problem where users analyze their data to estimate the conclusions the data will produce when incorporated into larger data sets. This project designs new algorithms for quantitative and automated methods to detect privacy-related phenomena that have been observed qualitatively. These algorithms support the development of usable privacy enhancing technologies and will give users tools to cope with and manage their data in a complicated data environment. These tools will provide awareness to users about how their data is being used. These analytics will also help answer questions critical to the development of privacy law and policy.<br/><br/>This work involves approximately twenty-five undergraduates in research activities, exposing them to research methods and privacy issues. This project also develops novel educational materials including course offerings for an interdisciplinary master's program in security and educational tools for use by the general public to bridge the digital divide.

Abstract: This grant funds approximately 20 U.S.-based graduate students to attend the 2015 USENIX Security Symposium (Security '15), a leading forum for advanced professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds to meet and discuss the newest advances in the security of computer systems and networks. Participation in Security '15 and similar conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers in the field, and exposes students to leading work in the field. The support enables the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference. In addition, this grant supports the first USENIX Women in Advanced Computing summit, which will encourage women to become involved in the security field.<br/><br/>USENIX Security '15 will be held in Washington, DC, in August 2015. The conference consists of a three-day technical program, with numerous workshops co-located. The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers, practitioners, system administrators, system programmers, and others interested in the latest advances in the security of computer systems and networks. This cross-disciplinary emphasis makes it well suited as a target for student participation, and this event has always drawn a large proportion of student attendees. This venue provides an excellent vehicle for students to learn about the latest advances in computer security research, and participate in engaging discussions on a wide variety of sub-topics including network and system security, techniques for developing secure systems, technologies for trustworthy computing, hardware security, applied cryptography, etc. <br/><br/>A new feature in USENIX Security 2014 which will be continued for 2015 is the creation of a 'shadow' program committee to help graduate students learn about the publication review process.

Abstract: The Internet was not designed with information controls, such as censorship or surveillance, in mind. However, its importance has led many nations to repurpose Internet protocols (e.g., the Domain Name System (DNS) and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)), and network management products (e.g., Web proxies, traffic shapers) for information control. This unintended use of networking technologies can lead to unintended international impact of censorship, and raises many ethical issues when network management products are exported to countries that use them to violate human rights. <br/><br/>To address these challenges, this project: (1) develops a platform which enables repeatable measurements of Internet censorship while mitigating risks to individuals performing the measurements, (2) designs techniques to analyze data from the platform to detect different types of censorship and even specific network management products used for censorship, and (3) uses the platform to quantify instances of national censorship which have unintended international impact on the Internet. <br/><br/>The use of technology to restrict freedom of speech and persecute dissidents around the globe is a human rights concern. This project provides high fidelity technical data to inform policy discussions. Further, the technical analysis provides insights into the global impacts of national censorship on the Internet, and how proposed improvements to existing protocols (e.g., DNSSEC, BGPSEC) can mitigate these issues.

Abstract: Pluggable types allow programmers to extend a language's type system to enhance program correctness and program security. Unfortunately, pluggable types require annotations in the program, and therefore, place a burden on programmers. This annotation burden is one reason why pluggable types have not been widely adopted in practice. This project will develop techniques that will allow programmers to realize the benefits of pluggable types without incurring the annotation burden. One concrete application (and thrust of the project) tackles security and privacy of Android apps.<br/><br/>Pluggable types will become more important, as JSR 308 (Type Annotation Specification) becomes part of Java 8 in 2014. The PI has developed a framework for inference and checking of context-sensitive pluggable types. The framework is instantiated to nontrivial systems and has inferred and checked close to a million lines of Java code in a modular and compositional manner. The key innovations in the framework are (i) support for context sensitivity, which allows instantiation to precise type systems such as Purity and Ownership, and (ii) a scalable inference engine, which allows type inference with zero or very small number of programmer annotations. The key insight is that viewpoint adaptation, a concept from Universe types, elegantly enables context sensitivity, both in the specification of the type system and in the type inference analysis. The project will advance the framework towards applications in concurrency, sustainable computing and security. Notably, the project will leverage the framework towards modular and compositional information flow analysis for Android; this will help address standing issues such as (i) the large Android library, and (ii) implicit information flow.

Abstract: This project develops a holistic approach to sociotechnical system security that combines innovations in both criminology and engineering/computer science. We design unified sociotechnical security models that capture how sociotechnical intrusions against social as well as technical aspects of the system (i.e., modeled as hidden sequences of system security states) result in observed hard data such as security sensor alerts and soft data produced by human/social sensors such as reports about slow machines. <br/><br/>To model the social aspect of the sociotechnical security models, (1) we collect extensive social survey data from one specific subpopulation (employees) nested within one sociotechnical system (the university campus); (2) we identify various social and social-psychological factors reducing susceptibility to victimization by computer-focused crime drawing on several criminological and sociological theories; (3) we supplement social survey data with organizational-level data to explore influences of characteristics of organizational units on individual-level employee victimization by computer-focused crimes as well as rates of such cybercrime threats in organizational units. We analyze the collected data by applying unique integrated sociotechnical analytical approaches that encapsulate the adversarial actions and subsequent rewards/costs using stochastic Markov decisions processes and probabilistic data production models. <br/><br/>Our research provides guidelines for other researchers looking to incorporate social science methods and models into engineering systems, with the criminological/sociological aspect of the study of use to many other researchers. This work will transform how researchers approach the problem of sociotechnical security, in that our holistic view cognizant of both social and technical factors will become widespread.

Abstract: Modern multicore and manycore architectures have a number of new security threats. For example, shared microarchitecture components such as caches, core inter-connection networks, and memory controllers can be exploited for side-channel attacks or denial of service attacks. The evolution of workloads to exploit explicit parallelism will also likely lead to additional new threats. New forms of active viruses and trojans that reside on some cores and attempt to attack other applications are likely to arise. It is critical to anticipate such new forms of threats and design manycore systems in a manner that facilitates defeating them. If security is not treated as a first order design principle, these systems will be highly vulnerable to attacks, leading to enormous losses in money and productivity and a substantial effort to retrofit security in after the fact. The overall theme of this project is to identify and analyze security threats that can arise in a multicore and manycore environment and develop algorithms and techniques to address these threats in a complexity-effective manner and without sacrificing performance. Specific interest is on the techniques and solution patterns that can be reused to help with different threats. These include the use of additional cores and thread contexts to provide security without significant performance losses, and the development of techniques for virtual and physical isolation of shared resources to defend against sidechannel attacks and denial-of-service attacks. In addition, the project explores approaches for trading-off performance and security and also considers security vulnerabilities of new memory technologies.

Abstract: Statistical privacy, or the problem of disclosing aggregate statistics about data collected from individuals while ensuring the privacy of individual level sensitive properties, is an important problem in today's age of big data. The key challenge in statistical privacy is that applications for data collection and analysis operate on varied kinds of data, and have diverse requirements for the information that must be kept secret, and the adversaries that they must tolerate. Thus, application domain experts, who are frequently not experts in privacy, cannot directly use an existing, general-purpose privacy definition. Instead, they must develop a new privacy definition or customize an existing one. Currently there exist no rigorous techniques to customize privacy to applications.<br/><br/>This project builds PROTEUS, a general-purpose toolkit for developing rigorous privacy definitions and mechanisms that can be customized to applications. The cornerstone of PROTEUS is a novel privacy framework that allows customized privacy protection by explicitly listing the secrets to be protected, enumerating the (potentially infinite set of) possible adversaries, and ensuring rigorous bounds on the information disclosed to each adversary about every secret. Novel theoretical tools in PROTEUS include methods to reason about privacy for correlated data, privacy against realistic adversaries, and techniques to express and enforce personalized privacy preferences. These tools result in practical privacy mechanisms for publishing social science survey data, social network analysis, and analysis of user-activity streams. Broader impacts of this project include developing new courses in privacy and big-data management, as well as technology transfer to the US Census.

Abstract: The Internet will shape the history of the 21st century. Governments around the world realize this, which is why, out of 40 countries studied by the Open Net Initiative, Internet censorship increased from 3 of 40 in 2002 to 26 of 40 in 2007. The U.S. must set effective policy regarding this, but the inherently computational issues lead to a great deal of uncertainty. We are studying the dynamics of modern Internet censorship implementations to understand how their low-level mechanisms (for example, at the level of individual Internet packets) affects the application-level behavior of censorship that web users actually experience.<br/><br/>Internet censorship implementations are inherently computational, thus whether or not content is available to a user can depend on key issues such as routing and protocol dynamics. Current characterizations of censorship are incomplete, not founded on quantitative measurements, and cite experiments that cannot be reproduced. We are addressing this by laying a solid computational foundation for Internet censorship research. Central to this effort is Internet measurement of existing censorship implementations to understand and compare their dynamics at the packet- and application-level. This will impact both policy development and the future design of computer networks to address Internet censorship, a critical issue that directly harms U.S. interests by hindering the ability of human rights organizations and U.S. government agencies to disseminate information. Understanding the connections between Internet censorship and computational issues will also enable the integration of this research throughout the computer science curriculum at UNM and other institutions.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) encompass a large variety of systems including for example future energy systems (e.g. smart grid), homeland security and emergency response, smart medical technologies, smart cars and air transportation. One of the most important challenges in the design and deployment of Cyber-Physical Systems is how to formally guarantee that they are amenable to effective human control. This is a challenging problem not only because of the operational changes and increasing complexity of future CPS but also because of the nonlinear nature of the human-CPS system under realistic assumptions. Current state of the art has in general produced simplified models and has not fully considered realistic assumptions about system and environmental constraints or human cognitive abilities and limitations. To overcome current state of the art limitations, our overall research goal is to develop a theoretical framework for complex human-CPS that enables formal analysis and verification to ensure stability of the overall system operation as well as avoidance of unsafe operating states. To analyze a human-CPS involving a human operator(s) with bounded rationality three key questions are identified: (a) Are the inputs available to the operator sufficient to generate desirable behaviors for the CPS? (b) If so, how easy is it for the operator with her cognitive limitations to drive the system towards a desired behavior? (c) How can areas of poor system performance and determine appropriate mitigations be formally identified? The overall technical approach will be to (a) develop and appropriately leverage general cognitive models that incorporate human limitations and capabilities, (b) develop methods to abstract cognitive models to yield tractable analytical human models (c) develop innovative techniques to design the abstract interface between the human and underlying system to reflect mutual constraints, and (d) extend current state-of-the-art reachability and verification algorithms for analysis of abstract interfaces, iin which one of the systems in the feedback loop (i.e., the user) is mostly unknown, uncertain, highly variable or poorly modeled.<br/><br/>The research will provide contributions with broad significance in the following areas: (1) fundamental principles and algorithms that would serve as a foundation for provably safe robust hybrid control systems for mixed human-CPS (2) methods for the development of analytical human models that incorporate cognitive abilities and limitations and their consequences in human control of CPS, (3) validated techniques for interface design that enables effective human situation awareness through an interface that ensures minimum information necessary for the human to safely control the CPS, (4) new reachability analysis techniques that are scalable and allow rapid determination of different levels of system safety. The research will help to identify problems (such as automation surprises, inadequate or excessive information contained in the user interface) in safety critical, high-risk, or expensive CPS before they are built, tested and deployed. The research will provide the formal foundations for understanding and developing human-CPS and will have a broad range of applications in the domains of healthcare, energy, air traffic control, transportation systems, homeland security and large-scale emergency response. The research will contribute to the advancement of under-represented students in STEM fields through educational innovation and outreach. The code, benchmarks and data will be released via the project website.<br/><br/>Formal descriptions of models of human cognition are in general incompatible with formal models of the Cyber Physical System (CPS) the human operator(s) control. Therefore, it is difficult to determine in a rigorous way whether a CPS controlled by a human operator will be safe or stable and under which circumstances. The objective of this research is to develop an analytic framework of human-CPS systems that encompasses engineering compatible formal models of the human operator that preserve the basic architectural features of human cognition. In this project the team will develop methodologies for building such models as well as techniques for formal verification of the human-CPS system so that performance guarantees can be provided. They will validate models in a variety of domains ranging from air traffic control to large scale emergency response to the administration of anesthesia.

Abstract: Consider a network where each node is either good or bad. The good nodes all run an algorithm that attempts to achieve a specific goal. The hidden set of bad nodes are controlled by an adversary who uses them to thwart this goal.<br/><br/>Informally, cost-competitive analysis considers the resource cost of each good node as a function of the total resource cost of the adversary. The goal is to design algorithms that achieve their objectives, while minimizing this cost. Critically, when bad nodes suffer higher costs than good nodes, it is expected that they will eventually cease their attack, as their resources become depleted.<br/><br/>Goals of this project are to design cost-competitive algorithms for: communication in wireless networks; tolerating distributed denial-of-service attacks; secure routing in peer-to-peer networks; and enabling nodes to come to agreement.<br/><br/>Cost-competitive analysis offers a novel approach for making progress on challenging attacks that cannot be adequately addressed in models that ignore the costs of the attacker. By adopting a more realistic attack model, this approach more accurately quantifies the limits of efficient attack resistance. It is thus expected that a cost-competitive approach will yield more compelling solutions to security challenges in many domains. In particular, this project may have high impact in security challenges involving open environments such as: wireless sensor networks, overlays, reputation systems; and aspects of contemporary problems in industry such as: public cloud computing, reliable versions of MapReduce, and robust distributed lock managers like Google's Chubby lock service.

Abstract: Increasingly, both personal and enterprise data are being stored at third-party locations, outside of the data owner's control. A company might directly outsource its data storage by using a backup service such as Amazon's S3 application. In other cases, outsourcing is a by-product of a larger service; for example, several corporations use Salesforce to manage their customer relations and sales data. Outsourcing data storage offers several benefits: storage costs can be amortized by a third-party over several customers, a third party can store data at different geographic locations for robustness, and integration with larger application services becomes easier. One can imagine a not too distant future where most computation and storage is realized in a network "cloud". In order to protect data stored at third party services we will need to encrypt it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, traditional encryption systems are insufficient for these applications. Solving this problem requires an entirely new way of encrypting data. To see this, recall that in traditional public key encryption a party encrypts data to a single known user. While this functionality is useful for applications such as encrypted email and establishing secure web sessions, it lacks the expressiveness needed for more advanced data sharing. In enterprise settings, a party will want to share data with groups of users based on their credentials. Often a party sharing data will not know which individual users will need to have access to it; moreover, some users will not even exist in the system at the time the data is encrypted. For example, a traveling sales representative might want to encrypt records so that any current or future manager in the personal electronics division can access them.<br/><br/>The proposed research is laying the foundations for an entirely different vision for encryption called Functional Encryption. Instead of encrypting to individual users, in a functional encryption system, one can embed any access predicate f() into the ciphertext itself. Functional encryption simultaneously renders completely general functionality and its data access is self-enforcing --- requiring no trusted mediator. The PI aims to create a system where the encrypting party can specify any access predicate over a recipient's credentials (i.e. f can be any Turing Machine). Functional encryption for any predicate opens up a world of possibilities for data sharing; one could encrypt an image such that the access function f encoded an image recognition program allowing only people in the picture to view it.<br/><br/>In addition to broadening our view of public key cryptography, the PI will explore fundamental problems in public key encryption. One direction is to attempt to build chosen ciphertext secure encryption from standard public key encryption. Finally, the PI will explore the foundations of building public key cryptography.

Abstract: Modern software systems inherit their architecture, software development methodology, and security model from time-sharing operating systems developed four decades ago. Desktop, server, cloud, and even industrial control systems rely on a large stack of commercial off-the-shelf software that runs on top of a monolithic operating system kernel. Each application runs with the full set of privileges of some user, has access to the entire file space of that user, and can access the complete interface of a complex operating system kernel, and a number of privileged systems components. The security model exposed by existing software systems is fundamentally too weak; it fails to provide adequate isolation between computations.<br/><br/>XCap is a secure environment for least-authority execution of applications and system services. Unmodified, untrusted, off-the-shelf applications, running on untrusted operating systems, are isolated by a virtual machine monitor. XCap builds on two principles: strong isolation and secure collaboration. XCap's default -- a share nothing environment -- is augmented by a capability access control model: a clean and general abstraction, enabling fine-grained delegation of rights in a flexible and manageable way. In XCap, capabilities serve as a general foundation for constructing least privilege services out of existing components of the traditional operating system stack. XCap maximizes the principle of least authority: it redesigns common operating system services in such a way that the authority of individual applications and services is minimized. Each component possesses the smallest subset of rights required to accomplish its task.

Abstract: Typically, an electronic component goes through process of design, fabrication, assembly, distribution, usage in the system, and finally end of life. Obsolete integrated circuits (ICs) are commonly targeted by counterfeiters through recycling, remarking, and cloning. If counterfeit components end up in critical applications such as defense, aerospace, automotive, or medical systems, the results could be catastrophic. This research will raise awareness of counterfeiting, piracy, and electronic components recycling and remarking issues which will have positive socioeconomic effects on electronic components innovation and growth, rights' holders and consumers.<br/><br/>Detecting these counterfeit ICs is an extremely difficult task because of the large number of counterfeit types, part types, and defects and anomalies associated with the counterfeit parts. In this project, we develop innovative 2D/3D optical imaging for detecting exterior physical defects, novel 3D X-ray imaging technologies for interior physical defects detection and to eliminate the need for decapping of ICs, and a Tera-Hertz imaging technology for exterior and interior physical defects detection.

Abstract: Proposal ID: 0844995, PI Name: Mohammad Tehranipoor, PI Institution: University of Connecticut, Title: CAREER: Novel Techniques for Detecting and Localizing Hardware Trojans in Integrated Circuits<br/><br/>Abstract: <br/><br/>Design and fabrication of integrated circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly vulnerable to malicious activities and alterations with globalization. These vulnerabilities have raised serious concerns regarding possible threats to many critical applications. An adversary can introduce a Trojan designed to disable and/or destroy a system at some future time or the Trojan may serve to leak confidential information covertly to the adversary. This research develops efficient procedures for detection of malicious alterations and subtle modifications in integrated circuits. Side-channel signal analysis methods as well on-chip measurement structures are developed to detect and localize the inserted Trojans in very deep submicron ICs. Novel design-for-hardware-trust techniques are developed in this project to increase the capabilities and effectiveness of the detection and isolation strategies. <br/><br/>The Intellectual Merit of the research is the development of techniques optimized to improve the level of confidence that an IC will carry out its intended function and nothing more. The broader impact is (i) the development of techniques for hardware authentication that would be of interests to US government, agencies and many fab-less semiconductor companies, (ii) the societal benefits that include trustworthy electronics for healthcare, defense weapons and dependable computing platforms for intelligence, weather forecasting, and transportation, (iii) the education of undergraduate and graduate students, (iv) the development of new courses, and (v) the dissemination of data and methodologies to researchers in academia and industry.

Abstract: As Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) employing mobile nodes continue to integrate into the physical world, ensuring their safety and security become crucial goals. Due to their mobility, real-time, energy and safety constraints, coupled by their reliance on communication mediums that are subject to interference and intentional jamming, the projected complexities in Mobile CPSs will far exceed those of traditional computing systems. Such increase in complexity widens the malicious opportunities for adversaries and with many components interacting together, distinguishing between normal and abnormal behaviors becomes quite challenging.<br/><br/>The research work in this project falls along two main thrusts: (1) identifying stealthy attacks and (2) developing defense mechanisms. Along the first thrust, a unifying theoretical framework is developed to uncover attacks in a systematic manner whereby an adversary solves Markovian Decision Processes problems to identify optimal and suboptimal attack policies. The effects of the attacks are assessed through different instantiations of damage and cost metrics. Along the second thrust, novel randomization controllers and randomization-aware anomaly detection mechanisms are developed to prevent, detect and mitigate stealthy attacks.<br/><br/>The outcomes of this CAREER project will ultimately provide concrete foundations to build more secure systems in the areas of robotics, autonomous vehicles, and intelligent transportation systems. The educational activities--as in curriculum development and hands-on laboratory experiences--will provide students with the essential skills to build dependable and trustworthy systems, while ensuring the participation of undergraduates, women and underrepresented minorities. The outreach activities will expose high school students to Computer Science education and scientific research.

Abstract: Third-party hardware Intellectual Property (IP), written as code in a Hardware Description Language (HDL), is extensively used in modern integrated circuits. Contemporary electronics typically include 75% of third party hardware IP and only 25% in-house design to provide customization or a profit-making edge. Such extensive use of third-party hardware IP in both commercial and military applications raises security and trustworthiness concerns, especially in today's globalized market. Malicious modifications to a module's HDL code may introduce vulnerabilities, jeopardizing the security of the larger system within which it is integrated. So how does one protect electronics from the threat of potentially tampered with third-party hardware IP? To this end, this project is developing a framework for facilitating acquisition of provably trustworthy microprocessor cores. Drawing concepts from software proof-carrying code (PCC), security-related properties are codified in a temporal logic to outline the boundaries of trusted operation. In the case of microprocessor cores, these security properties ensure that the microprocessor instruction set architecture (ISA) does not introduce malicious architectural state changes, thereby preventing attackers from using a programming interface to exploit maliciously introduced hardware modifications. A formal proof of these security properties is then crafted by the vendor and presented to the consumer, who can automatically check correctness and validate compliance to the security properties. An ecosystem for developing provably trustworthy microprocessor cores, including a foundations framework, libraries, software tools, and demonstrations, as well as an educational module on Trusted Integrated Circuits and Systems are being developed as part of this project.

Abstract: This project aims to advance our fundamental understanding of secrecy over arbitrary wireless networks. Over the last decade we have significantly deepened our fundamental understanding on how to send information over wireless networks, while our understanding on how to securely send this information has not reached the same depth as yet. This project aims to develop a unifying theory that enhances wireless secrecy by exploiting wireless properties such as: the existence of feedback (today part of all wireless standards); the possibility of selecting and using multiple network communication paths; the smart use of wireless jamming and the wireless channel variability and unpredictability. We enable this by "building on erasures:" through appropriate coding and smart wireless jamming, we convert (Gaussian) wireless networks to erasure networks. We then develop protocols that use interaction and feedback to enable provable security against active and passive adversaries, even if they are computationally unbounded. <br/><br/>The project also promotes the training of research engineers: we will integrate the research into the curriculum via the creation of novel coursework combining the underlying concepts in wireless communication, network coding/protocols, and information theory. The research in this project, if successful, will contribute to the fundamental sciences of information theoretic network security and secure network coding. Given our increasing dependence on wireless devices as a portal for socio-economic activities, wireless security will have broad implications in mobile commerce.

Abstract: This project studies Internet censorship using novel measurement techniques, ranging from low-level packet filtering on Internet Protocol (IP) networks to high-level censorship of social media content. Collectively these techniques can provide greater situational awareness of censorship dynamics. <br/><br/>The project focuses on a suite of advanced inference techniques for when ?direct observation? is unavailable or impractical such as, for example, methods for detecting IP tunnels based on per-hop Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) inference techniques in order to reason about the physical characteristics of a given IP network and, for example, measurement on social media postings of redactions and the speed of redactions. <br/><br/>This research has broad implications on studies of methods to provide awareness of restrictive control of information and content on networks, which would be of interest to software developers, system administrators, and policy makers alike.

Abstract: Increasing cyber security depends on our ability to guarantee that the system will provide the expected functionality under normal circumstances as well as if the system is perturbed by some random events or security threats. Providing such guarantee is often complicated due to several factors such as changes in system requirements caused by user demands, exposure to a new threat model that was not considered (or not relevant) in the original design, or identifying bugs or vulnerabilities during a system life cycle. The purpose of the project is to develop automated techniques --that provide justifiable confidence about correctness-- to transform an existing software model into a new model that satisfies both the existing functionality and the desired security requirements. <br/><br/>Developing algorithms that generate models that satisfy existing functionality and new security requirements poses new challenges due to the fact that existing trace-based properties do not suffice for several security properties. A characteristic of trace-based properties is that if a model satisfies a trace-based property and it is restricted by removing some undesired behaviors then the revised model still satisfies that trace-based property. Hence, adding a trace-based property can be achieved by removing behaviors that violate it. Since trace-based properties cannot express several security properties, this project will utilize a new formalism, hyperproperties, that generalizes trace-based properties and can be used for modeling security requirements. In particular, a hyperproperty consists of a set of trace-based properties and to satisfy that hyperproperty it is required that the repaired program exhibit `all? behaviors in one of these properties.<br/><br/>To develop algorithms that justifiably provide assurance about models developed by them, this project will first focus on formalizing commonly used security requirements using hyperproperties. It will perform complexity analysis to evaluate the complexity of adding different security properties to an existing model. To mitigate cases where the complexity is high, it will develop heuristics and algorithms that (1) identify whether adding the given hyperproperty can be achieved via adding a related stronger trace-based property, and (2) identify a subset of hyperproperties where adding the given property is more efficient. This work will also result in the development of efficient algorithms and tools that utilize the complexity bottlenecks. Thus, the results of the proposed project will enhance assurance of software systems by repairing security flaws and vulnerabilities in an automated fashion.

Abstract: Modern automobiles are no longer mere mechanical devices; they are pervasively monitored and controlled by dozens of digital computers coordinated via internal vehicular networks and bridged to external networks as well. While this transformation has driven major advancements in efficiency, safety and convenience, it has also introduced a broad range of new potential risks. In this effort, we are evaluating these risks by experimentally mapping the attack surface of the modern automobile, identifying architectural security and privacy vulnerabilities, and developing new defense methodologies that can provide safety within the rubric of the existing automotive design ecosystem.

Abstract: It is often assumed that the use of robots to help people execute tasks will result in better performance than if the person or robot were operating alone. However, research in automated systems suggests that the performance of a human-machine system depends on the extent to which the person trusts the machine and the extent to which this trust (or distrust) is justified. As robots are being developed to aid people with complex tasks, it is critical not only that we build systems which people can trust, but that these systems also foster an appropriate level of trust based on the capabilities of the systems. A user who does not have an appropriate level of trust in the robot may misuse or abuse the robot's autonomous capabilities or expose people to danger. This project proposes to develop quantitative metrics to measure a user's trust in a robot as well as a model to estimate the user's level of trust in real time. Using this information, the robot will be able to adjust its interaction accordingly. <br/><br/>Promoting appropriate levels of trust will be particularly beneficial in safety-critical domains such as urban search and rescue and assistive robotics, in which users risk harm to themselves, the robot, or the environment if users do not trust the robot enough to rely on its autonomous capabilities. The research has the potential for a large impact on the field of human-robot interaction as few studies have explicitly examined issues involving trust of robots. Being able to model trust and foster appropriate levels of trust will result in more effective use of robotic automation, safer interactions, and better task performance.

Abstract: Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology has the flexibility of implementing a large part of physical layer functions in software. It is one of the major technologies that will provide broadband services to millions of US residences. However, unlike conventional radio whose RF signals are tightly regulated by FCC-certified hardware, the software components of SDR can be easily exploited by hackers to create a wide range of unauthorized waveforms to launch attacks on many security-critical wireless systems. The existing preventive software-based security counter measures are not possible to prevent the myriad of potential software security loopholes and themselves often become targets of the malware. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to design an effective hardware-based SDR integrity assessment and behavior regulation device named SDR Shield. SDR Shield resides between the vulnerable SDR software and the security-critical SDR hardware to detect any malicious configuration of the RF device and prevent it from being used to attack wireless systems. The SDR Shield uses side channel and communication channel information from different SDR components to detect deviations from expected execution status. SDR shield also includes a regulation circuit to enforce safety-critical properties of SDR operation. A secure update process is developed to maintain SDR shield?s flexibility and its own security. The generality of SDR Shield?s design provides a unified security mechanism for SDR design and hence can ease the burden on FCC or any future SDR design verification institutes in certifying security measures of SDR products.

Abstract: OpenSSH reveals excerpts from encrypted login sessions. TLS (HTTPS) reveals encrypted PayPal account cookies. DTLS is no better. EAXprime allows instantaneous forgeries. RFID security has been broken again and again. All of these failures of confidentiality and integrity are failures of authenticated ciphers: algorithms that promise to encrypt and authenticate messages using a shared secret key.<br/><br/>It is easy to blame many of these security problems on a lack of education: much stronger authenticated ciphers have been in the literature for many years. However, in many cases these stronger authenticated ciphers fail to meet the performance requirements of the applications. Performance is exactly the motivation for RC4 in WEP; EAXprime in the "Smart Grid"; HB in RFID; and "IPsec" continuing to support unauthenticated encryption.<br/><br/>This project is building a new generation of authenticated ciphers that improve efficiency without compromising security and that improve security without compromising efficiency. This work spans seven main topics: more efficient ciphers; more efficient MACs; more efficient forgery rejection; improved protection against side channels; improved protection against misuse and bad luck; improved quantitative security; and improved security proofs. The ultimate objective is to obtain the best possible security subject to a variety of performance constraints specified by cryptographic users.<br/><br/>The high-security high-performance authenticated ciphers produced in this project will be directly and straightforwardly usable in cryptographic applications, avoiding the disasters in current applications and finally bringing secure secret-key cryptography from theory to practice.

Abstract: Computers are often deployed in a deterministic fashion, even across unrelated infrastructures, in order to simplify their life-cycle management. Unfortunately a predictable environment also aids attackers since a small set of exploits can be applied across a large number of similarly configured computers. A Moving Target (MT) strategy can be used to address this problem by deploying less deterministic and homogenous systems. For example intermittently changing a system's configuration (operating systems and/or applications) can create a MT defense that limits the usefulness of an attacker's knowledge; however, these alternative configurations must be functional and secure, while diverse.<br/><br/>This research explores a new Moving Target (MT) defense strategy that leverages Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to manage computer configurations. The technique discovers better solutions (configurations) by mimicking processes found in nature. Computer configurations are modeled as chromosomes, where configuration parameters, or settings, are individual chromosome traits. The GA proceeds by applying a series of selection, crossover, and mutation processes to discover new chromosomes from a pool. Since the system constantly evolves, it is designed to cope with new vulnerabilities or functionalities that can be potentially introduced over time.<br/><br/>An important objective is the development a prototype MT system that can provide a better understanding of the performance of evolutionary-based configuration management. Results will be of interest to researchers and practitioners since the approach is applicable to a variety of configurations. Furthermore this project will also introduce undergraduates to academic research in the area of computer security and system management.

Abstract: Despite rampant criticism of passwords and an abundance of alternative proposals for user authentication (e.g., biometrics), passwords are not likely to be replaced in the near future due to their ease of deployment and familiarity to users. Indeed, while a number of policies for improving password systems have emerged, the most widely adopted of these is to simply increase the size of the space from which passwords are drawn. Even so, for user-chosen secrets, these policies generally make passwords harder to remember and type, leading to user frustration. Worse, users generally fulfill these policies in predictable ways, impairing the security benefits they are intended to provide.<br/><br/>This project leverages linguistic expertise to develop techniques that provide memorable passwords through both user input and automated processes. Specifically, we explore the formation of pronounceable authentication strings that lead to improved system security and a decreased burden on users (by providing memorable, hint-able, easily type-able passwords that are resistant to attack). Our user-influenced, but system-generated, pronounceable strings combine source words to make lexical blends (aka portmanteaus, e.g., flamingo + mongoose -> flamongoose), or elicit user-generated blends from system-suggested semantic domains. Additionally, we examine techniques for rating pronounceability of word-like strings, allowing us to quantify pronunciation difficulty and proactively apply rigorous security analysis techniques to the space of pronounceable word-like strings. The broader significance of the work is to increase our collective understanding of the driving forces behind string pronounceability and the complex relationships involved in human and automated formation of lexical blends.

Abstract: It is generally recognized that protecting online privacy is important, with modern society manifesting this concern in many ways. Preliminary research indicates that third parties, with modest crawling and computational resources, and employing simple data mining heuristics, can potentially combine online services and publicly available information to create detailed profiles of the users living in any targeted geographical area.<br/><br/>This research investigates measures that can significantly improve privacy protection of users, while not degrading their overall Internet experience. The focus is on less-trustworthy third parties (e.g., data brokers, advertisers, spammers, malware distributors, and pedophiles), who can scrape, aggregate and infer information from many different online and offline sources. This research has two interrelated research thrusts. First, it explores to what extent third parties can collect, aggregate, and statistically process information from OSNs and other online and offline sources to create profiles. This thrust is developing rigorous statistical methodologies and probabilistic models for estimating the degree of potential privacy leakage. Second, this research investigates a variety of privacy policies that governments can establish, and a wide range of measures OSNs can take, to reduce the privacy risk. For promising combinations of policies and measures, this research quantifies the trade-off between privacy protection and usability.

Abstract: If an Integrated Circuit (IC) is designed and fabricated in a foundry that is outside the direct control of the (fab-less) design house, reverse engineering, malicious circuit modification, and Intellectual Property (IP) piracy are all possible. An attacker, anywhere in this design flow, can reverse engineer the functionality of design, and steal and claim ownership of the IP. An untrustworthy IC foundry may overbuild ICs and sell the excess parts in the gray market. Rogue elements in the foundry may insert malicious circuits (hardware Trojans) into the design without the designer's knowledge. Because of these and similar hardware-based attacks, the semiconductor industry annually loses billions of dollars. In this project, the investigators aim at leveraging techniques proposed in the context of IC testing to cope with manufacturing defects for developing defense techniques that help regain trust in electronic chips. <br/><br/>Benefits to society ensuing from successful completion of this project include trustworthy electronics for healthcare, defense, finance, transportation, and automotive applications. One of the investigators received a grant from the US Department of Education to recruit underrepresented minorities and women into the Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD program at NYU-Poly. This applicant pool will be used to recruit underrepresented minorities and women to work on this project. The investigators routinely advise undergraduates as part of the NYU-Poly Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program, and the NSF REU program. These undergraduate students will be eligible to work on the present project as well. One of the investigators has developed a graduate course on Introduction to Trustworthy Hardware. The investigators will adapt some of these course modules for inclusion in appropriate undergraduate courses at their institution.

Abstract: Both sound software verification techniques and heuristic software<br/>flaw-finding tools benefit from the presence of software annotations<br/>that describe the behavior of software components. Function summaries<br/>(in the form of logical annotations) allow modular checking of software<br/>and more precise reasoning. However, such annotations are difficult to<br/>write and not commonly produced by software developers, despite their<br/>benefits to static analysis.<br/><br/>The Crowdsourcing Annotations project will address this deficiency by<br/>encouraging software-community-based crowd-sourced generation of<br/>annotations. This effort will be supported by tools that generate, use,<br/>and translate the annotations; the results of annotation efforts will be<br/>shared through openly available repositories. We will also use pilot<br/>projects to demonstrate and encourage the use of annotations and static<br/>analysis. The project will leverage and interact with the Software Assurance Marketplace (SWAMP)<br/>project's collection of static analysis tools and example software. Some<br/>of the technical challenges are developing uniform styles and languages<br/>for annotations, reliably validating crowd-sourced submissions, merging<br/>annotations and the corresponding source code, version control, and<br/>integration with typical software development environments. The social<br/>challenges are also important: designing and implementing a<br/>crowd-sourcing infrastructure in a way that enhances and motivates<br/>community and individual technical and social benefits.

Abstract: This collaborative research between Florida State University and Cornell University is to identify language-action features from text-based messages that can be used to dynamically infer a social actor's perceived trustworthiness. The team will investigate using optimal analysis techniques to calibrate trustworthiness reasoning, which can be used to computationally model actors' deceptive behaviors in cyber space and to infer actors' intent based on their words and actions.<br/><br/>This research will have a transformative impact in understanding the dynamics of trusting relationships through observing language-action features and psychosocial trustworthiness attribution mechanisms. This study serves as a precursor to a socio-technical schema that will facilitate national security and data protection for the general populace while also protecting the individual's right to privacy. This study will contribute to the science of cyber-security, and will help the cyber-security community to understand and enable trustworthy communication and collaborative information behavior among computer-mediated groups in a systematic way.

Abstract: Many application protocols on the Internet, especially those used by malware, are proprietary and have no publicly released specifications. According to the Internet2 NetFlow weekly reports on backbone traffic, more than 40% of Internet traffic belongs to unidentified application protocols. Therefore, it is critical for network security solutions to understand the specifications of these unknown application protocols. For instance, protocol specifications are needed for parsing unknown application protocol in advanced intrusion prevention systems. Protocol specifications are also useful for many other applications such as vulnerability discovery and system integration. Furthermore, even for some application protocols with known specifications, protocol inference is also needed sometimes for identifying implementation details and bugs that are not unambiguously specified. Inferring protocol specification for unknown application protocols is therefore fundamental to network security.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop schemes for automatically inferring the protocol specification of unknown applications from their network traces. The PI proposes a semantics aware approach that takes network traces as the input and automatically outputs the inferred protocol message format. This project represents the first effort towards developing semantics aware approaches to protocol inference, a fundamental building block of many network security solutions. This project is potentially transformative research with high-impact. It will enable a spectrum of new network security applications and solutions. The proposed project is interdisciplinary in nature as it applies natural language processing techniques to network security problems.

Abstract: This project investigates the feasibility of secure, robust, and usable gesture-based authentication as an alternative to traditional alphanumeric passwords and biometrics. It is motivated by the rapid increase in authentication-related security breaches and by the emergence of new human-computer interfaces. While the breaches have demonstrated the seriousness of the issue, two emerging types of gesture-based interfaces, multi-touch (smartphones, tablets) and camera-based (Kinect), offer a unique opportunity for robust solution.<br/><br/>The benefit of gesture-based authentication over a purely-biometric one lies in the fact that it combines involuntary biometric features (e.g., hand shape), that are irrevocable, with user-controlled voluntary characteristics that can be easily changed. Three research thrusts are being pursued: 1) gesture recognition algorithms (search for robust gesture features, their compact representation, and reliable classification algorithms), 2) human factors (study of uniqueness, repeatability, ergonomics, device dependence of gestures, and gesture complexity) and 3) security considerations (evaluation of authentication performance under a range of performance measures and different threat models). <br/><br/>A successful completion of this research will catalyze the development and adoption of next-generation authentication methods that are critically needed at the personal, institutional, and governmental levels. As the price paid (time, money, and resources) to repair a security breach can be astounding, this project will have substantial societal impact by increasing the sense of security and reducing breach-related costs. At educational level, this project is involved in middle and high school outreach at Boston University as well as the annual cybsersecurity competition CSAW at NYU-Poly.

Abstract: One of the keys to scientific progress is the sharing of research data. When the data contain information about human subjects, the incentives not to share data are stronger. The biggest concern is privacy - specific information about individuals must be protected at all times. Recent advances in mathematical notions of privacy have raised the hope that the data can be properly sanitized and distributed to other research groups without revealing information about any individual. In order to make this effort worthwhile, the sanitized data must be useful for statistical analysis. This project addresses the research challenges in making the sanitized data useful. The first part of the project deals with the design of algorithms that produce useful sanitized data subject to privacy constraints. The second part of the project deals with the development of tools for the statistical analysis of sanitized data. Existing statistical routines are not designed for the types of complex noise patterns that are found in sanitized data; their naive use will often result in missed discoveries or false claims of statistical significance. The target application for this project is a social science dataset with geographic characteristics. The intellectual merit of this proposal is the development of a utility theory for algorithms that sanitize data and statistical tools for their analysis. The broader impact is the improved ability of research groups to share useful, but privacy-preserving, research data.

Abstract: Security risks associated with software that communicates over networks have become an increasingly costly problem for consumers, firms, and governments. A key characteristic of any interconnected system (e.g., network software such as Apache HTTP server, the smart grid, and airline baggage operations) is that choices made in the design, deployment, and usage of these systems can have significant implications for security risk. Because these choices are often driven by economic tradeoffs, both firm and consumer incentives can be designed to encourage the development of systems that are less vulnerable. Further, due to the fact that seemingly disparate systems are connected through the network, security weaknesses in one system can rapidly cause major problems for another. Because of these negative externalities, governments may need to intervene through regulation or legislation to ensure the security of critical components of the public infrastructure (e.g., the Internet). This project develops a research framework to analyze the relationship between government policy, economic incentives of firms and consumers, and software security risks of networks. The goal of the project is to gain new insights into how the efforts of firms, consumers, and government can be coordinated to improve software security. To better understand this socio-technical problem, the research will generate formal economic theory to analyze the complex interactions between these entities, each of whom has varying economic incentives. Three important aspects of the software security landscape are studied: software liability, the impact of software deployment models, and open source software incentives for security. To clarify the interplay between public and private forces on security, this research program rigorously studies the role of government in setting policy on software liability, security investment, and technology-specific subsidization to help control software security risks. It will provide guidelines on how software liability should be employed in a context with security interdependence. Also, since design choices by software firms partially determine a given product?s risk exposure to both directed and undirected security attacks, a modeling framework is built to examine how each type of attack distinctly influences software security in consideration of user behavior; the results have important implications for optimal software design. An important outcome of the work is to combine for the first time research on the economics of open source software with that on security risk, two significant streams of research in the literature. In this dimension, the project investigates whether open source software can lower security risks and lead to socially preferable outcomes.<br/><br/>By advancing one?s understanding of how to manage software security risk, this project will have wideranging impacts. First, the results will provide guidance to policy makers on how to craft policies which account for firm and user behavior while mitigating the enormous social and economic losses from security attacks on software. Since software security is critical to national defense, one priority is to keep an open dialogue with appropriate government agencies on the project?s outcomes. Second, this work can advise software firms on improved software design and using source code strategy to achieve greater security. Third, society can benefit substantially from improved software and reduced economic losses. By involving undergraduate and graduate students in the research process, the project will provide mentorship on economic modeling and quantitative analysis. As part of the educational activities, a case study that focuses on the interaction between open source incentives and security risk will be generated.<br/>By integrating the research findings and the case study with IT curricula, the project will educate future business leaders on IT strategy and security.

Abstract: As seen by the proliferation of commercial-grade malware, attacking networked applications is a profitable enterprise. There are two advantages malware authors currently have against us. The first advantage is that because users run a diverse set of applications on their systems, anti-virus and anti-malware programs must exhaustively search for specific malware instances across all pieces of software on a system. Malware easily thwarts this through the use of polymorphism, metamorphism, obfuscation, and cryptographic packing, placing a financial burden on anti-malware vendors and a performance burden on their users. The second advantage malware authors enjoy is that while there are a lot of applications to attack, each software target is static across many client machines. As a result, malware authors only need to reverse and exploit a single instance of an application in order to compromise thousands of machines. This project examines two novel approaches for reversing the advantages held by malware authors. The first approach explores a white-listed execution model that extends integrity-checks beyond the operating system and into the running application in an on-line manner. The second approach explores the on-line, run-time transformation of applications in order to force a malware adversary to reverse and exploit a new application for each new client it wishes to compromise. Finally, the project aims to demonstrate the impact these techniques have on the cost of developing malware.

Abstract: This project is developing new techniques for manipulating sensitive data by exploring two related areas, computing on private keys and computing on authenticated data. Currently, a private key is an inert object that gives its holder the ability to perform a cryptographic operation on all messages, as may be the case when generating a signature. The project is exploring a new vision, in which computing on the private key itself creates new restricted private keys that can only perform restricted operations such as, for example, signing only some messages but not others. In the case of computing on authenticated data -- data for which integrity is important but secrecy is not -- the project is developing new tools to compute on such data and obtain authenticated results.<br/><br/>The project is committed to the dissemination of research results, education of students, and outreach to industry. Overall, the proposed project will produce a next generation of technology for managing authenticated and encrypted data while advancing the field of applied cryptography and educating the next generation of researchers.

Abstract: Attacks on software applications such as email readers and web browsers are common. These attacks can cause damages ranging from application malfunction, loss of private data, to a complete takeover of users' computers. One effective strategy for limiting the damage is to adopt the principle of least privilege in application design: the application is split into several protection domains and each domain is given only the necessary privileges to perform its task. In this design, the compromise of one domain does not directly lead to the compromise of other security-sensitive domains. The PI proposes to design and implement a framework that makes it easy for software developers to apply the principle of least privilege to their applications. The proposed framework will significantly improve the security of critical software applications. It will benefit the software industry by designing new technologies for building secure software systems.<br/><br/>The proposed research combines several novel ideas: (1) user-space protection domains through binary-level enforcement of isolation and information-flow security; (2) a declarative language that allows for flexible configuration of an application's security architecture; (3) a binary-level partitioning tool that automatically splits an application into components of least privilege; (4) a compositional reasoning mechanism that allows developers to perform formal reasoning about an application's end-to-end information security. By staying in the user space, the proposed framework is OS independent, and by working on binary code, it is source-language agnostic, making it more broadly applicable. Developers can use it to partition an application, flexibly configure its security architecture, and reason about its information security. On the education side, the PI will organize a series of activities to increase high school students' awareness of security, privacy, and secure programming. The central activity is a summer workshop that gathers local high-school technology teachers and helps them design lesson plans that can be integrated into their schools' technology curriculum.

Abstract: The award supports the attendance of fifty US-based students to attend the sixth Federated Logic Conference (FLoC 14) which will be held in Vienna, Austria, in July 2014, as part of the Vienna Summer of Logic (VSL 14). The federated logic conference is an event which brings together ten major international conferences in the area of Formal Methods, and around 75 satellite workshops. While the participating conferences are normally held individually by their local conference organization on an annual basis, they all agree to this joint and federated event to be held every three-four years.<br/><br/>Enhancing the security, privacy, usability, and reliability of computing systems is widely accepted as one the grand challenges facing the computing-research community. Formal Methods have emerged as one of the primary approaches towards that goal. A federated conference provides an opportunity for accelerating research via synergy between the different strands of research in Formal Methods. It is also an outstanding training opportunity for young researchers, as it offers them a grand view of the whole area.

Abstract: The operating system (OS) exercises complete control over applications, thus a compromise of the OS compromises every application. Software developers have little recourse to improve security in the face of system compromise---they cannot defend against OS vulnerabilities, nor can they reasonably substitute a secure version of the millions of lines of code that constitute a modern OS.<br/><br/>Rather than require applications to blindly trust OS interactions, this project investigates a system architecture that enables trusted applications to efficiently verify OS interactions with the help of a small, trusted hypervisor. Most verification work is performed within the C language runtime, minimizing changes to legacy code and shielding developers from increased programming complexity.<br/>The prototype system, called InkTag,improves upon prior work in several key areas: it provides more efficient techniques to verify system call results, implements usable access control for resources managed by an untrusted OS, and introduces hardware and software techniques to further reduce the size of the trusted computing base.<br/><br/>Cloud computing provides energy and economic efficiencies, but suffers from the inability to give meaningful security guarantees to hosted applications. This project demonstrates that system security is possible without trusting the OS---a large part of the hosted infrastructure. This project is also developing new materials for undergraduate and graduate curricula that combine core knowledge of systems with an understanding of how systems provide security properties, equipping future computer professionals with a better understanding of what security guarantees a system can meaningfully provide.

Abstract: Software is responsible for many critical government, business, and educational functions. This project aims to develop new methods for finding and repairing some of the most challenging, poorly understood security vulnerabilities in modern software that have the potential to jeopardize the security and reliability of the nation's cyber infrastructure.<br/><br/>The first objective of this project is to design and implement a robust program analysis framework that is capable of finding exploitable semantic bugs in modern applications, such as accidental omission of access-control checks, unintentional exposure of sensitive operations such as native calls and database queries to untrusted code or users, high-complexity control structures vulnerable to denial of service, misconfigurations of security policies, and other errors in programs' security logic.<br/>The second objective is to develop methods for automatically repairing semantic vulnerabilities by applying program transformations that insert correct implementations of appropriate security logic.

Abstract: Internet miscreants cooperate for profit in identity theft, denial of service, etc.  Meanwhile, defending organizations act separately and treat Internet information security (infosec) as a cost to be minimized. Customers could choose more wisely among competing Internet firms if they knew which had good or bad security, and such fame or shame would cause firms to improve security to retain and attract customers.<br/><br/>To verify such a policy of peer influence, this project uses a readily available stand-in for organizational infosec: outbound spam (unsolicited bulk email).  Other security problems may not cause outbound spam, and this project makes no claims to solve all problems.  However, just as a sneeze indicates disease, spam indicates poor infosec that could be exploited for even worse purposes (theft, denial of service, blackmail, etc.), and no organization wants to be seen to have such problems.<br/><br/>The project ranks similar organizations in SpamRankings.net, using daily data from multiple anti-spam blocklists, aggregating it from IP addresses into routing blocks (Autonomous Systems), and categorizing their owners by geography and type (hosting, medical, ISP, etc.).  Field experiments, including the relative effects of different publicity strategies, seek to determine whether publishing information on a symptom of infosec (outbound spam) causes firms to improve that symptom.<br/><br/>Positive experimental results will serve as stepping stones to policy recommendations of legislative mandates of timely and publicly accessible incident disclosure to enable more third-party peer rankings for further infosec improvement.  Minimal enforcement could thus catalyze significant improvements in Internet usability, profitability, and national security.

Abstract: CAREER: Protecting Privacy in Untrusted Environments<br/>----------------------------------------------------<br/>PI: Vitaly Shmatikov (The University of Texas at Austin)<br/><br/>Information about individuals and organizations is increasingly collected<br/>in massive databases, sent over public networks and shared across<br/>organizational boundaries. This presents serious threats to privacy:<br/>even if individual pieces of data are cryptographically protected,<br/>sensitive information may still leak out due to mismatches between<br/>privacy policies of different components.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop tools and techniques for protecting privacy<br/>of sensitive data, focusing on three main research thrusts. The first<br/>thrust is protection of public databases containing individual information<br/>such as medical records, transactions, and preferences. This includes<br/>design of provably secure methods for enforcing access policies directly<br/>in published data, development of analysis tools for finding privacy<br/>vulnerabilities, and evaluation on real-world data. The second thrust<br/>is design and implementation of formal methods for checking privacy<br/>policy compliance in order to ensure that data processing applications<br/>do not violate the stated privacy policies of the enteprise. The third<br/>thrust is development of new methods for analyzing privacy-preserving<br/>communication networks.<br/><br/>Protecting data privacy is important not only for individuals, but<br/>also for businesses and organizations that deal with individual data.<br/>New technologies developed as part of this project will help detect<br/>potential privacy violations and enforce privacy policies. They will<br/>enable applications dealing with sensitive personal and organizational<br/>data to be executed in open computing environments and support many<br/>socially important tasks such as multi-institution medical trials that<br/>do not violate patients' privacy and collaborative analysis of Internet<br/>security threats.

Abstract: Cloud computing allows users to delegate data and computation to cloud providers, at the cost of giving up physical control of their computing infrastructure. An attacker with physical access to the computing platform can perform various physical attacks, referred to as digital insertion and observation attacks, which include probing memory buses, tampering with memory, and cold-boot style attacks. While memory encryption can prevent direct leakage of data under digital observation, memory access patterns to even encrypted data may leak sensitive information. This work will allow organizations to securely outsource their computing infrastructure to an untrusted cloud provider, while preserving a similar level of security as if hosting the infrastructure in house<br/><br/>This project will develop DIORE (Digital Insertion and Observation Resistant Execution) which is a combined hardware software platform immune to digital insertion and observation attacks. DIORE provides memory-trace oblivious execution, relying on efficient hardware implementations of Oblivious RAM, and novel compiler techniques for partitioning programs such that Oblivious RAM accesses are minimized. This ensures that an adversary with access to a program execution's memory trace learns nothing about the code or data other than what is revealed intentionally. DIORE opens up possibilities for new cloud applications involving sensitive information such as genomic, medical, or financial data -- domains that are considered too privacy sensitive for today's cloud.

Abstract: This frontier project tackles many of the fundamental research challenges necessary to provide trustworthy information systems for health and wellness, as sensitive information and health-related tasks are increasingly pushed into mobile devices and cloud-based services. The interdisciplinary research team includes expertise from computer science, business, behavioral health, health policy, and healthcare information technology to enable the creation of health & wellness systems that can be trusted by individual citizens to protect their privacy and can be trusted by health professionals to ensure data integrity and security. Although these problems are motivated by a nationally important application domain (health and wellness), the solutions have applications far beyond that domain.<br/><br/>This project is developing methods to authenticate clinical staff to tablet computers in a continuous and unobtrusive way, and to provide patients a usable way to control the information that mobile sensors collect about them. One of the goals is to manage security of healthcare devices in the home and in remote clinics, without adding burden on the homeowner or clinical staff; towards this end the investigators are developing methods to verify medical directives issued to remote devices. One approach being investigated is segmenting access to medical records from mobile devices to limit information exposure, and developing methods to audit behavior of this complex ecosystem of devices and systems. The investigators will design tools to handle genomic data in the cloud while enabling patient control over information, detect malware in medical devices through power analysis, and provide contextual information to those who use health data collected in the field.

Abstract: Fixing software bugs is a difficult and time-consuming process, accounting for up to 90% of the lifetime cost of a typical program. Because the number of defects outstrips the resources available for repairing them, most software is shipped with both known and unknown bugs. This research builds upon a novel, fully-automated method for repairing bugs in existing software, producing trustworthy repairs for real-world programs. The research will be broadly applicable, targeting large legacy applications with many testcases.<br/><br/>The technical focus of the work is a scalable and trustworthy technique to automatically repair program bugs. Program variants are evolved, using analogues of biological processes such as mutation, until one is found that both retains required functionality and avoids the defect. Thousands of standard software testcases, program invariants, mined specifications, and "fuzz" inputs are used to represent bugs, encode program requirements, and build trusted repairs. Empirical evaluations include an automated hardening scenario: programs and attacks against them are coevolved over time, simulating parts of the security arms race. Significant potential outcomes include: a scalable and trustworthy automated program repair methodology and freely available tools; advances in formal program analyses; significant efforts in outreach and education; and dissemination of the results.

Abstract: Social networking services have been transformed from one-stop websites, to social interaction platforms deeply integrated with third-party websites, applications, and even operating systems. As prominent examples, social plugins such as Facebook's Like and Google's +1 buttons enable websites to offer personalized content and allow their visitors to seamlessly share and interact with their social circles, while Facebook and Twitter support is already integrated in iOS 6. These social features offer multifaceted benefits to both users and content providers, and have driven their widespread adoption across the web and the mobile application ecosystem. However, this increasing integration has raised concerns about the implications of these social features to user privacy, as they enable social networking services to track a growing part of their members' activity, including their browsing histories, locations, and communications.<br/><br/>The research in this project seeks to address these privacy concerns by exploring a novel design for privacy-preserving virtual private social networks, which fulfills two seemingly contradicting requirements: it protects user privacy by minimizing the transmission of user-identifying information to the social networking platform, while preserving all existing functionality by delivering the same personalized content. The main insight of this approach is to shift content personalization from a server-side to a client-side process, by decoupling the retrieval of potentially sensitive social information from the presentation of personalized content that uses that information. The PIs are developing a personalized "information overlay" that prefetches information from a user's social circle independently of third-party accesses, and keeps this information consistent across the user's devices. The outcomes of this research effort are expected to significantly improve the privacy of members of social networking services, without degrading the current personalization experience to which they have grown accustomed.

Abstract: Computer performance has doubled many times over during the past 40 years, but the very techniques used to achieve these performance gains have made it increasingly difficult to build systems that are provably safe, secure, or reliable. This fact significantly impedes progress in the development of our most safety-critical embedded systems such as those found in medical, avionic, automotive, and military systems. A transformation in the way that these systems are created is needed, one that uses new hardware design techniques, computer architectures, and programming languages to create classes of hardware/software systems with formal and provable safety properties that are verifiable all the way down to the implementation level of bits and logic gates.<br/><br/>This research will change the way that hardware and embedded systems designers approach the problem of provable properties, enabling them to directly control and analyze the system at the lowest level and to statically determine if their designs are in compliance with a given policy. For example, if a system must be real-time this property can be verifiable for a full system, from gates to software, by ensuring that the architecture design carefully manages interference through a set of new hardware primitives, software designed to exploit these new primitives, specialized hardware analysis tools, and new design languages. To ensure this technology will have impact beyond academia the PIs are making these new technologies available and accessible through easy to use tools, continuing to include undergraduates at all levels of research to help train a new generation of engineers capable of designing safety-critical systems, and integrating concepts from information assurance into their extensive outreach activities. Over the long term this research will help create the skills and tools that embedded system engineers need to evaluate the trustworthiness of their systems, and it will ease the development of those critical systems on which we all depend on for our safety and livelihood.

Abstract: This project will investigate, prototype and evaluate CloudFence, a proposed framework that allows users to independently audit the treatment of their private data by third-party online services, through the intervention of the cloud provides hosting said services. Specifically, the PI will investigate, novel techniques for conducting fine-grained tracking of ``information of interest'' (as defined by the user of the cloud service, in a flexible, context-sensitive manner) toward (a) providing increased transparency to end users of the handling of their information by the cloud, and (b) enabling the periodic (or even continuous) auditing of said handling, either by the user or an agent acting on her behalf. <br/><br/>The underlying hypothesis is that it is possible to create a general-purpose, application-agnostic information tracking mechanism across the cloud that can operate on both legacy and newly developed applications, such that users can leverage their trust on the infrastructure provider without imposing unreasonable constraints on said provider (e.g., not requiring manual inspection of applications). <br/><br/>The project will take a systems approach, aiming to demonstrate the feasibility, effectiveness, and limitations of CloudFence by applying it to real problems encountered in managing the cloud computing infrastructure of the PI's department; a significant part of the effort will go toward system evaluation. Tangible results of the effort include (a) a new architectural framework for information auditing in a cloud environment, (b) software prototypes demonstrating the concepts, (c) conference and journal publications and reports, and (d) a network security lab focusing on cloud and web security.

Abstract: Information systems that handle personal information must adhere to<br/>legal regulations, corporate privacy policies, and contractual<br/>agreements designed to protect personal privacy. Relying exclusively<br/>on application designers and developers for such assurances is<br/>unrealistic. There is a need for methods and tools that can identify<br/>errors in the handing of personal data and provide formal assurances<br/>that personal information is handled appropriately.<br/><br/>This project is developing a software development framework that uses<br/>novel language-based techniques to ensure that software enforces<br/>privacy policies. Privacy policies (based on legal and regulatory<br/>requirements) are formally specified in temporal logic, and identify<br/>circumstances under which information can be shared (based on criteria<br/>such as the roles of individuals involved, prior events, and whether<br/>the data has been aggregated) and future obligations that are incurred<br/>as a result of the information sharing. The framework consists of<br/>policy analysis tools, a programming language, program analysis tools<br/>that verify both privacy and declassification policies are enforced,<br/>and a runtime environment. Used in concert, these components produce<br/>distributed information systems that verifiably handle personal<br/>information appropriately.<br/><br/>The framework being developed by this project will address problems<br/>faced by many information systems. However, the project will focus<br/>especially on the needs of the medical industry, both with respect to<br/>patient records and clinical trials. As medical practice transitions<br/>to electronic medical records, the need for high-assurance systems<br/>becomes increasingly acute. This project will develop the<br/>capabilities needed to verify that electronic medical records<br/>systems comply with applicable privacy policies.

Abstract: As the amount of digital information explodes, two new trends are emerging. First, data is increasingly being stored and managed in the "cloud", an untrusted trove of computing power and storage space for rent. Second, computer devices (e.g., cars, cell phones, medical implants) are everywhere and continuously exchanging messages.<br/><br/>This research addresses the security issues raised by these trends by developing cryptography-based security solutions for processing large volumes of data in an untrusted setting. The main goals are (1) practical solutions for outsourcing sensitive computations to untrusted parties and (2) new methods for automatically converting a standard signature verification procedure into one that efficiently processes a batch of messages. An initial focus is to explore pairing-based solutions as a means of keeping the bandwidth overhead low. The primary technical challenges are designing formal models to capture the desired security guarantees, designing efficient systems and testing these systems in practical settings.

Abstract: Multi-core architecture with 4 to 8 cores on a die is a reality today and future generations of processors are expected to contain even more cores per chip. This project targets to realize the full potential of large-scale multi-core processors as a secure and trustworthy computing substrate. First, in "many-core" processors, the availability of a large number of processing elements together with constraints on power consumption alleviates the need for heavy time-sharing of resources, which often results in various types of side-channels. This change enables the use of more dedicated and statically allocated resources in this project to provide strong isolation and a simplified trusted software base. Second, many programmable processing elements in large-scale multi-cores can serve as a general substrate for various types of fine-grained inspection. This project is developing a flexible architecture framework for various run-time checks with minimal overheads in order to automatically detect, diagnose, and recover from malicious software attacks. Finally, the project extends the architectural framework to other aspects of trust beyond security, focusing on post-silicon verification, where the dynamic inspection can ensure various correctness properties. The research will deliver the benefits of hardware support in security and verification without requiring dedicated resources for a single fixed mechanism. Users can use each "extended core" for various security purposes, for verification and reliability purposes, or even for general computing. At the same time, the research will also enable highly secure execution environments where critical software components can be better protected.

Abstract: It is widely estimated that one in four computers is part of a botnet, and therefore under the control of an attacker. These computers are used to loot bank accounts, send spam, and perform DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. The attacker almost always gains control of these computers by remotely attacking applications or the operating system on which these applications depend. The robustness---the ability to withstand attack---of the operating system has long been known as essential to produce secure systems. But even the most robust operating system cannot prevent applications from being exploited, and therefore has a limited effect on application robustness.<br/><br/>This project investigates the effect of the operating system on application robustness, and in particular the effect that the operating-system interface (the architecture and details of its system calls) has on the ability to write more robust applications. In particular, this project seeks to eliminate pitfalls in system calls; these pitfalls lead to security holes and make application development much more difficult. Eliminating pitfalls (and thus the resulting security holes) makes it more difficult to successfully attack applications. To evaluate the extent to which pitfalls can be eliminated, this project is building a operating system called Ethos. The Ethos interface will be analyzed and evaluated on its own and versus those in traditional operating systems.

Abstract: Social networking and sensor-rich devices such as smartphones are becoming increasingly pervasive in today's society. People can share information concerning their location, activity, fitness, and health with their friends and family while benefiting from applications that leverage such information. Yet, users already find managing their privacy to be challenging, and the complexity involved in doing so is bound to increase. Usable techniques are required to enable people to effectively manage the dissemination of their private information as sensed by their mobile devices and sensors in their environment. <br/><br/>This project explores `sensible' privacy controls and feedback mechanisms that allow people (or automated mechanisms acting on their behalf) to respond to unanticipated patterns and actual uses of their information in a way that is usable and intuitive. This approach has two advantages: 1) people need only care about the subset of data and usage scenarios that have the potential to violate their privacy, thus reducing the amount of data to which they must regulate access; and 2) people make better decisions concerning such access when these decisions are made in a context where they know how their data is being used. <br/><br/>Sensible privacy mechanisms can have a profound and positive societal impact by not only helping people control their privacy, but also potentially increasing their participation in sensor-enabled computing because of this added control. This project firmly integrates education into the research through research experiences for underrepresented groups and the development of course modules on privacy at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

Abstract: CAREER: Trust and Privacy Management for Online Social Networks<br/><br/>Online social networks greatly expand the scale of people's social connections, and have the potential to become an open computing platform, where new services can be quickly offered and propagated. Mechanisms for trust management and privacy protection are integral to the future success of online social networks. A trustworthy social network should allow users to flexibly control who can access their social information and to what extend. Online social networks also broaden the scope and scale of social science. Privacy issues arise naturally when the data of online social networks are shared for research and other purposes. <br/><br/>This project develops theoretical and practical techniques for the management of trust and privacy for online social networks. One central goal is to look into the future of online social networks and develop techniques that are not only suitable for today?s social networks but for the future open computing platform built on top of them. In particular, this project focuses on flexible trust models for social networks, privacy preserving feedback issuing and management, and graph anonymization for the sharing of social network data. The developed techniques directly help the secure development and deployment of a wide range of new types of services that are well beyond the realm of traditional online services. This project also develops educational materials to improve undergraduate students? understanding and interests in computer science and attract more students to enroll in computer science degrees.

Abstract: As one of the most promising emerging concepts in Information Technology, outsourced computation (also known as cloud computing) is transforming our perception of how IT is consumed and managed, yielding improved cost efficiencies and delivering flexible, on-demand scalability. Cloud computing reduces IT resources and services to commodities acquired and paid-for on-demand through a fast-growing set of infrastructure, platform, and service providers.<br/><br/>Despite the relatively fast growth and increased adoption of clouds, our understanding of aspects related to their security, privacy, and economic value proposition -- and hence our ability to trust them -- is lacking. This project addresses this challenge by (a) extending cloud service-level agreements to govern aspects such as integrity of outsourced services, information leakage control, and fair market pricing; (b) developing mechanisms that allow providers to guarantee and users to verify that such trust-enhancing service-level agreements are being followed; and (c) exposing trustworthiness guarantees and tradeoffs to cloud customers and system integrators in ways that are both practical and usable.<br/><br/>The research work pursued in this project is timely as it addresses the issues of cloud trustworthiness early enough to avoid having the conflicts among its various stakeholders develop unchecked -- as was the case with the Internet decades ago. Doing so has the potential of improving the utility and hardness of our cyber-infrastructure, with significant benefit to our economy and society. <br/><br/>The project will ultimately lead to a better marketplace for computing resources, in which users are assured that the services they acquire satisfy their performance, security, and privacy expectations.

Abstract: Programming languages research has many techniques for generating efficient, correct implementations from high-level specifications. Recent research on language-based security formulates models of information security in terms of modular, algebraic structures from language semantics. This research combines these threads in novel ways to construct high-assurance secure systems in which techniques from programming language semantics provide both a mathematical basis for formal verification and a flexible, modular organizing principle for system design and implementation. This methodology is illustrated with a case study in which kernels (in particular, separation kernels) with a verified security policy are synthesized directly from formal models of security. <br/><br/>There is growing interest within defense and avionics circles in separation kernels as a means of coping with serious concerns for system security, safety and integrity arising from the use of high levels of integration. Multi-level security (MLS) systems can be implemented by physical separation: computations at different security levels are situated on different network nodes. However, for many defense and avionics scenarios, physical separation is infeasible due to tight resource constraints. Because sharing resources introduces potential vulnerabilities, mission- or safety-critical MLS systems require both highly integrated implementations and high-assurance security guarantees. This research will have a direct impact on how separation kernels are designed, implemented and verified. Can the rigorous techniques for constructing modular and robust secure systems be generalized to other systems? The long range goal is to facilitate the construction of systems with high assurance end-to-end guarantees, thereby making high assurance more widely available.

Abstract: Computerized systems are present in various aspects of modern society. These systems are used to access and share confidential information. Such sharing is achieved through cryptographic protocols which often employ randomization to introduce unpredictability in their behavior to achieve critical security objectives and make it difficult for the malicious adversaries to infer the underlying execution of the participants. It is imperative to ensure that these protocols meet their security objectives such as confidentiality, privacy, fair exchange, anonymity and availability, as serious flaws have often been discovered in widely used cryptographic protocols. Given the ubiquitous role played by these security protocols and the socio-economic-political consequences that incorrect designs of cryptographic protocols may have, reasoning about their correctness is an important social imperative. This task is challenging because of the presence of malicious adversaries on the Internet as well as the subtle interaction between the concurrent nature of Internet and the various features such as cryptography and randomization used by the protocols. Hence, the development of automated techniques to verify their correctness is needed to manage this complexity, and this is the focus of this project.<br/><br/>The presence of randomization introduces subtle challenges in verifying the correctness of security protocols. In particular, when reasoning about adversarial behavior, one must only consider those behaviors in which the scheduling of actions of the adversary is independent of the private random choices of the individual participants. This project aims to develop scalable techniques and tools that faithfully, and automatically verify randomized cryptographic protocols by considering only attacks (by an adversary) that are oblivious of the private data and private coin tosses of protocol participants. There are primarily three research tasks identified in this project. First, theoretical completeness results will be established that will reduce the general security problem for unbounded protocol sessions, session identifiers, and messages to the finite bounded cases. The other two tasks will be devoted to making the finite bounded case more amenable to automation. In the second research task, we will develop automated techniques to verify safety properties of protocols based on new symmetry reduction techniques using SMT solvers. The third research task will develop automated techniques for verifying indistinguishability properties of protocols. We will investigate symmetry reduction techniques using SMT solvers for this task as well.

Abstract: Remarkable things can be achieved by harnessing power of the masses. By breaking down tasks and distributing to users, "crowdsourcing" systems can accomplish complex tasks such as translating books or creating 3D photo tours. Unfortunately, the opposite also holds: misuse of these systems creates powerful tools that can compromise the security of online communities, since today's security mechanisms focus on defending against automated scripts and fake accounts, but not real users.<br/><br/>In a malicious crowdsourcing system, customers initiate campaigns, and workers are paid for tasks such as creating Facebook accounts, posting fake Yelp reviews, or starting rumors on Twitter, with results indistinguishable from those of normal users. This type of malicious activity is called crowdturfing, because of its similarity to both crowd-sourcing systems and "astroturfing." The PIs have already found example sites today, and early measurements show some that generate over $1Million in annual revenue, while growing exponentially in users and revenue.<br/><br/>This project studies crowdturfing systems in detail via measurements and experiments, and use those results to develop robust defenses against them. Measurements and interviews will be used to study their support structure and incentives; develop endhost-based techniques to mark their results and economic solutions that reduce incentives for customers and workers; and build effective detection systems that identify crowdturfing in different domains using per-user behavioral models.<br/><br/>This work can change the way we view security in online communities, and its results can guide the deployment of new protection mechanisms that target crowdsourced fake user accounts and activities.

Abstract: This project aims at developing efficient methods for protecting the privacy of computations on outsourced data in distributed settings. The project addresses the design of an outsourced storage framework where the access pattern observed by the storage server gives no information about the actual data accessed by the client and cannot be correlated with external events. For example, the server cannot determine whether a certain item was previously accessed by the client or whether a certain algorithm is being executed. This property provides a high level of privacy protection that goes far beyond standard data encryption. The project also deals with advanced methods for verifying the correctness of outsourced computations, focusing on keyword searches and graph algorithms. The educational component of the project includes a curricular development effort for introductory computer security courses.<br/><br/>The project has applications to a broad range of web services widely used by business and consumers. Privacy-preserving access for outsourced data is relevant to web-based email and office applications. Also, it is especially important for the management of proprietary business data, medical data, and other sensitive personal data.

Abstract: Access control schemes are traditionally compared in terms of raw expressive power (i.e., the policies they can encode and how those policies can be changed); however, such comparisons ignore the needs of the application within which a scheme will be deployed. For some applications, the most expressive scheme may be overly complex and not necessarily the best fit. To this end, this project investigates the suitability analysis problem: Given a system's access control workload, a set of candidate access control schemes, and a set of application-specific cost metrics, which scheme best meets the needs of the system?<br/><br/>The goal is to create a suitability-analysis framework that is sufficiently rigorous to be useful to researchers and theoreticians, while remaining accessible to security practitioners. Such a framework will help formalize an access control scheme's application-specific strengths and limitations, enable researchers to precisely describe the scenarios for which a scheme is best suited, allow assessment of the novelty and utility of proposed schemes, and help analysts diagnose shortcomings in existing systems. In particular, the project will develop (1) an application-specific, workload-based framework for analyzing the suitability of access control schemes that is sufficiently rich to compare logical, extensional, and hybrid schemes in both sequential and concurrent systems; (2) a cost analysis component that quantifies a scheme's suitability using custom metrics; and (3) tools that automate a range of suitability analysis tasks. A real-world security workload, PKI-based authentication and authorization on the web, will be used to evaluate the results.

Abstract: The popularity of personal gadgets opens up many new services for ordinary users. Many everyday usage scenarios involve two or more devices "working together". (Emerging scenarios are beginning to involve sensors and personal RFID tags.) Before working together, devices must be securely "paired" to enable secure and private communication. <br/><br/>However, the human-imperceptible nature of wireless communication prompts the very real threat of Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks. Another challenge arises due to the lack of a global security infrastructure. Consequently, traditional cryptographic means alone are unsuitable, since unfamiliar devices have no prior security context and no common point of trust. Therefore, some human involvement in secure device pairing is unavoidable. At the same time, most devices have limited hardware and/or user interfaces, thus complicating human involvement. <br/><br/>This project?s goals are three-fold: (1) design a set of pairing methods suitable for most common devices and a general user population, based on comprehensive and comparative usability studies, (2) develop secure pairing techniques for personal RFID tags, and (3) construct a set of user-friendly, scalable and secure methods for sensor initialization. <br/><br/>Benefits of this project will include accumulation of valuable expertise in designing truly usable security methods. Notably, the project expects to experimentally assess the value of usable security with respect to the general population. Furthermore, the need for, and the utility of, user-centric secure control of personal RFID tags and sensors will be demonstrated. Since device pairing is one of the very few areas where security directly involves and affects the average user, the greatest impact of proposed research is expected to be the broader participation in security practices and better appreciation of security and its benefits. The project also emphasizes industry outreach and technology transfer by working with manufacturers and industrial consortia. <br/><br/>In addition, students taking part in the project are expected to acquire currently uncommon skills at the cusp of Human-Computer Interaction, Usability and Cyber Trust.

Abstract: Current information technology enables many organizations to collect, store, and use massive amount and various types of information about individuals. Governments and other organizations increasingly recognize the critical value and enormous opportunities in sharing such a wealth of information. However data privacy has been a major barrier for such information sharing, bringing much attention to privacy preserving data publishing and analysis techniques. Differential privacy is widely accepted as one of the strongest unconditional privacy guarantees. While many effective mechanisms have been proposed for the interactive model with differential privacy, non-interactive data release with differential privacy remains an open problem with the recent years only see negative results. <br/><br/>This project aims to build a data-driven and adaptive framework for differentially private data release. It circumvents the hardness of differentially private data release in the non-interactive setting by novel and sophisticated use of the differentially private primitives exploiting the characteristics of the underlying data. The specific research objectives include: (1) design adaptive query strategies for releasing data with differential privacy, including traditional relational data and high dimensional and sparse set-valued data, (2) design statistical inference technique to accurately answer user queries using the released data, and (3) design algorithms to model and incorporate potentially dynamic workload characteristics in the framework. In addition to formal analysis and experimental evaluations, the project will evaluate and integrate the developed solutions in real health applications at Emory University to support health research while providing rigorous privacy guarantee.<br/><br/>Success of the proposed research will help overcoming barriers for large scale data sharing and will have broader impacts to large societies beyond the field of data privacy and information management. The proposal also includes a set of closely integrated educational activities including new course development on data privacy and security emphasizing a strong interdisciplinary aspect, continued involvement of undergraduate students in research, and encouragement of women and minority for participation. The project also closely aligns with Emory's university-wide strategic initiatives in Predictive Health and will help develop the new Ph.D. program in Computer Science and Informatics at Emory University.

Abstract: With the advent of the world wide web and the resulting technologies such as social media, smart phones and sensor networks, the amount of data being collected has increased tremendously in recent years. Managing, storing, processing, analyzing and disseminating such massive amounts of data gives raise to many security and privacy challenges. To address these security and privacy challenges of managing and analyzing big data, an NSF Workshop on Big Data Security and Privacy has been proposed. Specifically, the workshop explores research topics including: policy management for big data; security and privacy for big data management and analytics; secure infrastructures and secure storage for big data; securing and analyzing massive networks; and big data analytics for security problems. The workshop participants are expected to be from academia, industry and government labs, consisting of interdisciplinary researchers in the fields of higher performance computing, systems, data management and analytics, cyber security, network science and policy and social sciences. They will come together and determine the strategic direction for big data security and privacy. Since research in big data security and privacy is of growing importance, this workshop is expected to have very high broader impacts.

Abstract: The Internet has become one of the most effective and common means of conveying expression that is likely to be controversial or suppressed. This freedom of expression is threatened by the now widespread practice of Internet censorship by both private and state interests.<br/><br/>The Tor network is one of several tools designed to allow users to safely and efficiently access censored content through one or more relay computers. Using these relays makes it difficult for a censor to determine what content is being accessed by whom. Unfortunately, this also makes it hard to measure the use and performance of these tools, leading to challenges in assessing the impact of the tools, and the security and performance of proposed alternatives.<br/><br/>This project is developing protocols and software to address these challenges, addressing three specific aims:<br/><br/>1. Developing and deploying cryptographic protocols that safely and privately measure and release important characteristics of the dynamics of the Tor network, including: number of users over time, user uptime and downtime distributions, user churn, network load, and exit statistics. <br/><br/>2. Enhancing the security and performance of Tor, using the data collected to improve evaluations.<br/><br/>3. Improving generic methods to circumvent relay blocking, including proxy distribution schemes, protocol steganography, and decoy routing.<br/><br/>The project is expected to result in widely-used datasets for evaluating censorship circumvention schemes, training of undergraduate and graduate students, and broad dissemination of free software that promotes freedom of expression on the Internet, against regimes that strongly oppose such expression.

Abstract: Natural language privacy policies have become a de facto standard to address expectations of notice and choice on the Web. Yet, there is ample evidence that users generally do not read these policies and that those who occasionally do struggle to understand what they read. Initiatives aimed at addressing this problem through the development of machine implementable standards or other solutions that require website operators to adhere to more stringent requirements have run into obstacles, with many website operators showing reluctance to commit to anything more than what they currently do. This project offers the prospect of overcoming the limitations of current natural language privacy policies without imposing new requirements on website operators.<br/><br/>This frontier project builds on recent advances in natural language processing, privacy preference modeling, crowdsourcing, formal methods, and privacy interfaces to overcome this situation. It combines fundamental research with the development of scalable technologies to semi-automatically extract key privacy policy features from natural language website privacy policies and present these features to users in an easy-to-digest format that enables them to make more informed privacy decisions as they interact with different websites. Work in this project also involves the systematic collection and analysis of website privacy policies, looking for trends and deficiencies both in the wording and content of these policies across different sectors and using this analysis to inform ongoing public policy debates. An important part of this project is to work closely with stake holders in industry to enable the transfer of these technologies to industry for large-scale deployment.

Abstract: As the Web is playing a more and more important role in our lives,<br/>it has become criminals' preferred targets. <br/>Web-based vulnerabilities now outnumber traditional computer security <br/>concerns. We believe that the root cause of many of these attacks<br/>is the Web's current access control models: they are<br/>fundamentally inadequate to satisfy the protection needs of today's web.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to re-design the access control models<br/>for the Web to fix the security problems at the fundamental level. <br/>We target two essential components of the Web infrastructure: browser and database. <br/>We have designed a generic access control model for web browsers<br/>to enforce the browser-side access control needs of web<br/>applications. The model replaces the web's current Same Origin Policy (SOP) model,<br/>which is the culprit of many of the security problems. The success of this task <br/>will help significantly reduce the number of security problems at the browser side.<br/>We have also designed DAC-DB, a Discretionary <br/>Access Control (DAC) model for database to automate the enforcement of DAC in<br/>web applications. With this model, web application developers can be liberated <br/>from implementing the complicated and error-prone security enforcement logics. <br/>Both access control models are designed based on the well-established security principles.<br/>To help disseminate our results, we will implement our designs <br/>for open-source web browsers and databases, and persuade the web<br/>community to adopt our models. The outcome of this research will also<br/>be converted to hands-on labs to enhance students' learning in<br/>system security.

Abstract: Correlation of seemingly innocuous information can create inference chains that tell much more about individuals than they are aware of revealing. However, while media coverage occasionally draws attention to privacy leaks on individual web sites, there is still no comprehensive analysis of the fundamental risks that users face in their online worlds. This project pursues such a study, focusing in particular on the threat of personal, yet publicly available information that can be correlated with modern multimedia retrieval and content analysis technologies. One thrust of the work is informing users about potential risks by exposing the broader possibilities that arise with more sophisticated privacy attacks. A second thrust concerns understanding the control that users can exercise over their privacy in the light of such potential. When analyzing the impact of "global inference" on privacy, the primary conceptual challenge concerns understanding the trade-off between the benefits that providing personal information to web services offers, versus the risks that doing so entails. By combining expertise from two traditionally separate communities---network security and multimedia---this work advances the start of privacy protection in an area that is poised to raise in importance as more information moves into public spaces. The project enables users to better understand the threats they are facing by developing scenarios that intuitively demonstrate the relevant effects; and it develops novel tools supporting them in better protecting their privacy. The research results will benefit the user community by promoting risk awareness and empowering control. The project also includes outreach activities including working with Berkeley Foundation for Opportunities in Information Technology (BFOIT) to recruit minority students in this research, organizing summer schools, and raising public risk awareness by working with Identity Theft 911.

Abstract: Safely managing the release of data containing confidential information about individuals is a problem of great societal importance. Governments, institutions, and researchers collect data whose release can have enormous benefits to society by influencing public policy or advancing scientific knowledge. But dissemination of these data can only happen if the privacy of the respondents' data is preserved or if the amount of disclosure is limited.<br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to bridge the gap between the statistics and computer science community and between theory and practice in limiting disclosure. The research focuses on limiting statistical disclosure using synthetic data, the most advanced method from the statistics community that enables the construction of public data sets with strong statistical properties; the research incorporates formal privacy guarantees from the computer science community into this approach. Techniques focus on household data and relational data dealing with real problems motivated by the U.S. Census Bureau and related agencies.<br/><br/>The approach of the team is based on the development of novel techniques for boosting the utility of synthetic data generation methods with formal privacy guarantees; novel formal privacy models that formalize attackers implicitly considered in the statistics literature, and new attacker models that allow an exploration of the space between weak and strong adversaries; and novel techniques designed for data from censuses or surveys about households which have a relational structure.<br/><br/>The research has broad impact by influencing the methodology of statistical agencies around the world. The project also develops a open-source toolkit for limiting disclosure in data publishing with formal privacy guarantees; it integrates undergraduate students into research, and it creates educational material for material for practitioners responsible for safe data handling.<br/><br/>For further information see the project web site at the URL:<br/>www.cs.cornell.edu/bigreddata/privacy

Abstract: Access control schemes are traditionally compared in terms of raw expressive power (i.e., the policies they can encode and how those policies can be changed); however, such comparisons ignore the needs of the application within which a scheme will be deployed. For some applications, the most expressive scheme may be overly complex and not necessarily the best fit. To this end, this project investigates the suitability analysis problem: Given a system's access control workload, a set of candidate access control schemes, and a set of application-specific cost metrics, which scheme best meets the needs of the system?<br/><br/>The goal is to create a suitability-analysis framework that is sufficiently rigorous to be useful to researchers and theoreticians, while remaining accessible to security practitioners. Such a framework will help formalize an access control scheme's application-specific strengths and limitations, enable researchers to precisely describe the scenarios for which a scheme is best suited, allow assessment of the novelty and utility of proposed schemes, and help analysts diagnose shortcomings in existing systems. In particular, the project will develop (1) an application-specific, workload-based framework for analyzing the suitability of access control schemes that is sufficiently rich to compare logical, extensional, and hybrid schemes in both sequential and concurrent systems; (2) a cost analysis component that quantifies a scheme's suitability using custom metrics; and (3) tools that automate a range of suitability analysis tasks. A real-world security workload, PKI-based authentication and authorization on the web, will be used to evaluate the results.

Abstract: This project takes a new approach to problems involving sensitive data, by focusing on rigorous mathematical modeling and characterization of the value of private information. By focusing on quantifying the loss incurred by affected individuals when their information is used -- and quantifying the attendant benefits of such use -- the approaches advanced by this work enable concrete reasoning about the relative risks and rewards of a wide variety of potential computations on sensitive data. <br/><br/>Specifically, this work has four main technical thrusts. The first is the development of new models and definitions, enabling privacy considerations to be incorporated into agent utility functions. The second is analysis of the feasibility and costs of eliciting sensitive information, in light of these models. The third focus is on enabling more sophisticated computations in settings where individuals value their privacy. Finally, more complex settings incorporate the interests of additional actors.<br/><br/>One of the goals of this project is not only to develop a science of the value of private information, but to build bridges between computer science and economics that will enable such work. Further, the models and algorithms developed by this project could inform future regulation regarding the use, exchange, and monetization of sensitive data. The project supports and is supported by a wide variety of educational goals, including significant research involvement of students at a range of stages, development of a course series with a substantial research component, and assessment of a pedagogical technique created to facilitate meaningful engagement with research literature.

Abstract: This research project studies a new area of research - exposure detection - that is at the intersection of data mining, security, and natural language processing. Exposure detection refers to discovering components/attributes of a user's public profile that reduce the user's privacy. To help the public understand the privacy risks of sharing certain information on the web, this research project focuses on developing efficient algorithms for modeling how an adversary learns information using incomplete and schemaless public data sources. Theoretically sound and efficient techniques for identifying accurate web footprints are introduced, including: new methods for data matching using a novel probabilistic join operator on multi-granular data, automated approaches for generating inference rules, and new solutions for identifying missing information and unifying mismatched vocabulary using lightweight natural language processing and text mining. The research activities also investigate methods for quantifying and adjusting exposure and risk, facilitating a better understanding of individuals' vulnerability on the web. These techniques not only advance the state of the art in re-identification, probabilistic reasoning and inference logic, and natural language understanding, but also serve as a foundation for exposure detection.

Abstract: This project aims at developing efficient methods for protecting the privacy of computations on outsourced data in distributed settings. The project addresses the design of an outsourced storage framework where the access pattern observed by the storage server gives no information about the actual data accessed by the client and cannot be correlated with external events. For example, the server cannot determine whether a certain item was previously accessed by the client or whether a certain algorithm is being executed. This property provides a high level of privacy protection that goes far beyond standard data encryption. The project also deals with advanced methods for verifying the correctness of outsourced computations, focusing on keyword searches and graph algorithms. The educational component of the project includes a curricular development effort for introductory computer security courses.<br/><br/>The project has applications to a broad range of web services widely used by business and consumers. Privacy-preserving access for outsourced data is relevant to web-based email and office applications. Also, it is especially important for the management of proprietary business data, medical data, and other sensitive personal data.

Abstract: To date, the application of quantitative security and privacy metrics metrics has seen its greatest successes when exploring the worst-case properties of a system. That is, given a powerful adversary, to what extent does the system preserve some relevant set of properties? While such analyses allow experts to build systems that are resistant to strong attackers, many deployed systems were not designed in this manner. In fact, there is growing evidence that users' privacy is routinely compromised as a byproduct of using social, participatory, and distributed applications. Given that people find inherent utility in using systems that are not secure against worst-case adversaries, this project investigates a complementary question: Can we help users better manage their participation in systems that are not privacy-preserving in an absolute sense?<br/><br/>This project is developing a principled approach that enables individuals to (i) quantitatively specify and assess their security, privacy, and utility goals; (ii) qualitatively express preferences on the relative importance of these goals; (iii) explore the implications of their system interactions by leveraging the trade-off spaces resulting from these quantitative and qualitative specifications; and (iv) enact locally-enforceable changes to their system usage to better balance competing needs. This project is designing computational tools that enable everyday users to better manage their system participation by understanding the interplay between security, privacy, and utility. Educational materials are being developed to support two undergraduate courses---one for computer science majors and one for non-majors---that explore the social, technical, and privacy implications of our increasingly digitized society.

Abstract: Traditionally, security on the Internet has been concerned with threats posed by edge nodes (hosts) to other hosts and to the middle nodes of the network (routers). However, in recent years,a rising number of instances in which hosts seek to defend themselves against the middle of the network can be seen. Examples include censorship and network neutrality violations, which fall into a general category of ?network manipulation?.<br/><br/>This project is exploring how to detect network manipulation through ?friendsourcing?, a strategy in which individuals use their social networks to get measurements from their friends. The project is developing a framework to facilitate this basic mechanism of analysis by addressing coverage, instrumentation, and co-operation. To obtain coverage, it must be possible to carry out recruitment that finds a collection of hosts in the right network locations. To deploy instrumentation, a software system capable of making the necessary measurements must be set up in such locations. To gain co-operation, it is necessary to rely on friending to get the help needed to realize the coverage and use the instrumentation.<br/><br/>Initial studies use limited coverage based on close friending and manual instrumentation. Later studies use broader coverage with theoretical underpinnings, more modular instrumentation, weaker friending ties, and more participants. Studies use a blend of theory (of coverage), software architecture (for instrumentation) and social network binding (to assess levels of cooperation). These studies provide better foundations for understanding the capacity of social networks and friendsourcing to measure Internet behavior and address network manipulation.

Abstract: This project aims at developing efficient methods for protecting the privacy of computations on outsourced data in distributed settings. The project addresses the design of an outsourced storage framework where the access pattern observed by the storage server gives no information about the actual data accessed by the client and cannot be correlated with external events. For example, the server cannot determine whether a certain item was previously accessed by the client or whether a certain algorithm is being executed. This property provides a high level of privacy protection that goes far beyond standard data encryption. The project also deals with advanced methods for verifying the correctness of outsourced computations, focusing on keyword searches and graph algorithms. The educational component of the project includes a curricular development effort for introductory computer security courses.<br/><br/>The project has applications to a broad range of web services widely used by business and consumers. Privacy-preserving access for outsourced data is relevant to web-based email and office applications. Also, it is especially important for the management of proprietary business data, medical data, and other sensitive personal data.

Abstract: Natural language privacy policies have become a de facto standard to address expectations of notice and choice on the Web. Yet, there is ample evidence that users generally do not read these policies and that those who occasionally do struggle to understand what they read. Initiatives aimed at addressing this problem through the development of machine implementable standards or other solutions that require website operators to adhere to more stringent requirements have run into obstacles, with many website operators showing reluctance to commit to anything more than what they currently do. This project offers the prospect of overcoming the limitations of current natural language privacy policies without imposing new requirements on website operators.<br/><br/>This frontier project builds on recent advances in natural language processing, privacy preference modeling, crowdsourcing, formal methods, and privacy interfaces to overcome this situation. It combines fundamental research with the development of scalable technologies to semi-automatically extract key privacy policy features from natural language website privacy policies and present these features to users in an easy-to-digest format that enables them to make more informed privacy decisions as they interact with different websites. Work in this project also involves the systematic collection and analysis of website privacy policies, looking for trends and deficiencies both in the wording and content of these policies across different sectors and using this analysis to inform ongoing public policy debates. An important part of this project is to work closely with stake holders in industry to enable the transfer of these technologies to industry for large-scale deployment.

Abstract: Smartphones and tablets are being used widely, and with such a pervasive use, protecting mobile systems is of critical importance. One of the unique features in mobile systems is that many applications incorporate third-party components, such as advertisement, social-network APIs, and the WebView component (that runs third-party JavaScript code). <br/><br/>With third-party components, the code developed by application developers and the code from third parties are executed within the same context and with the same privilege. No access control system is developed to separate the privilege of the first-party application code from that of third-party components. This has resulted in over-privilege issues. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop adequate access control systems to remedy the risks introduced by third-party components. The development is based on a systematic study of various third-party components, how they interact with applications, what features are desirable, and what their protection needs are. The project meets this objective using a three-pronged approach: (1) add new access controls to WebView to control the interactions with third-party code; (2) add package-level access controls within apps to prevent over-privilege; and (3) isolate third-party components with visual elements. <br/><br/>This project can offer mobile system developers a deeper understanding of the security problems in the systems, suggest to them how better to design into mobile systems desired security properties, and eventually improve the security of mobile systems.

Abstract: Outsourcing computation to the cloud has a difficult set of privacy challenges, a primary one being that the client cannot really trust cloud or application software. Encrypted computation achieves privacy by having the user specify encrypted inputs to a program in the cloud and returning encrypted results.<br/><br/>The design and implementation of a secure processor architecture, called Ascend, that guarantees privacy of data computed upon by untrusted programs and run on an untrusted operating system (OS) is underway. Our security goal is to only trust the Ascend processor chip and show that it is secure against software attacks and power analysis attacks on its pins even though application and system software can be malicious. Our performance goal is to show that execution time and energy overheads of encrypted computation are reasonable. The key idea in Ascend to guarantee privacy is obfuscated program execution: from the perspective of the Ascend chip's input/output and power pins, an untrusted server cannot learn anything about private user data regardless of the program run.<br/><br/>Through innovations in architectural mechanisms, security protocols, and applied cryptography, we hope to show that it is viable to only trust hardware and not trust any software in some security-conscious applications, thereby substantially minimizing the trusted computing base for these applications. The development of simulator infrastructure and hardware prototypes will allow the fruits of the research to be widely disseminated. This project will introduce high-school students to research in applied cryptography and security through an innovative high-school outreach program.

Abstract: Loss of personal data or leakage of corporate data via apps on mobile devices poses a significant risk to users. It can have both a huge personal and financial cost. This work is designing new novel techniques to help reduce the risks for end-users who use a single device for multiple spheres of activity. Getting security right when a single device is used for multiple spheres of activity is a major research challenge, with unforeseen information flows between various subsystems that are currently difficult to control. This project is developing mechanisms to better manage flows between apps on a mobile device so that users are able to compartmentalize different spheres of activity, such as work and personal use.<br/><br/>Broader impact: This research benefits both end-users who are concerned about the privacy of their data on mobile devices as well as businesses who wish to permit use of mobile devices for improving efficiency of their operations but are concerned about resulting security risks. Graduate and undergraduate students are trained in the area of security and privacy of information on mobile devices.

Abstract: As one of the most promising emerging concepts in Information Technology, outsourced computation (also known as cloud computing) is transforming our perception of how IT is consumed and managed, yielding improved cost efficiencies and delivering flexible, on-demand scalability. Cloud computing reduces IT resources and services to commodities acquired and paid-for on-demand through a fast-growing set of infrastructure, platform, and service providers.<br/><br/>Despite the relatively fast growth and increased adoption of clouds, our understanding of aspects related to their security, privacy, and economic value proposition -- and hence our ability to trust them -- is lacking. This project addresses this challenge by (a) extending cloud service-level agreements to govern aspects such as integrity of outsourced services, information leakage control, and fair market pricing; (b) developing mechanisms that allow providers to guarantee and users to verify that such trust-enhancing service-level agreements are being followed; and (c) exposing trustworthiness guarantees and tradeoffs to cloud customers and system integrators in ways that are both practical and usable.<br/><br/>The research work pursued in this project is timely as it addresses the issues of cloud trustworthiness early enough to avoid having the conflicts among its various stakeholders develop unchecked -- as was the case with the Internet decades ago. Doing so has the potential of improving the utility and hardness of our cyber-infrastructure, with significant benefit to our economy and society. <br/><br/>The project will ultimately lead to a better marketplace for computing resources, in which users are assured that the services they acquire satisfy their performance, security, and privacy expectations.

Abstract: Safely managing the release of data containing confidential information about individuals is a problem of great societal importance. Governments, institutions, and researchers collect data whose release can have enormous benefits to society by influencing public policy or advancing scientific knowledge. But dissemination of these data can only happen if the privacy of the respondents' data is preserved or if the amount of disclosure is limited.<br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to bridge the gap between the statistics and computer science community and between theory and practice in limiting disclosure. The research focuses on limiting statistical disclosure using synthetic data, the most advanced method from the statistics community that enables the construction of public data sets with strong statistical properties; the research incorporates formal privacy guarantees from the computer science community into this approach. Techniques focus on household data and relational data dealing with real problems motivated by the U.S. Census Bureau and related agencies.<br/><br/>The approach of the team is based on the development of novel techniques for boosting the utility of synthetic data generation methods with formal privacy guarantees; novel formal privacy models that formalize attackers implicitly considered in the statistics literature, and new attacker models that allow an exploration of the space between weak and strong adversaries; and novel techniques designed for data from censuses or surveys about households which have a relational structure.<br/><br/>The research has broad impact by influencing the methodology of statistical agencies around the world. The project also develops a open-source toolkit for limiting disclosure in data publishing with formal privacy guarantees; it integrates undergraduate students into research, and it creates educational material for material for practitioners responsible for safe data handling.<br/><br/>For further information see the project web site at the URL:<br/>www.cs.cornell.edu/bigreddata/privacy

Abstract: Computer users are increasingly faced with decisions that impact their personal privacy and the security of the systems they manage. The range of users confronting these challenges has broadened from the early days of computing to include everyone from home users to administrators of large enterprise networks. Privacy policies are frequently obscure, and security settings are typically complex. Missing from the options presented to a user is a decision support mechanism that can assist her in making informed choices. Being presented with the consequences of decisions she is asked to make, among other information, is a necessary component that is currently lacking.<br/><br/>This work introduces formal argumentation as a framework for helping users make informed decisions about the security of their computer systems and the privacy of their electronically stored information. <br/>Argumentation, a mature theoretical discipline, provides a mechanism for reaching substantiated conclusions when faced with incomplete and inconsistent information. It provides the basis for presenting arguments to a user for or against a position, along with well-founded methods for assessing the outcome of interactions among the arguments. An elegant theory of argumentation has been developed based on meta rules characterizing relationships between arguments. Rules for argument construction and evaluation have been devised for specific domains such as medical diagnosis. This project investigates argumentation as the basis for helping users make informed security- and privacy-related decisions about their computer systems. Three specific aims are addressed:<br/>1) Implementation of an inference engine that reasons using argumentation,<br/>2) Facilitate security management through an argumentation inference engine, a rule base specialized for security management, and sensors providing security alerts all enhanced with an interactive front-end.<br/>3) Reason about the consistency and completeness of domain knowledge, as it evolves.<br/>To understand the kinds of domain-specific inference rules required, diverse security applications are studied, such as determining if an attack imperils a particular system, finding the root cause of an attack, deciding on appropriate actions to take in the presence of an uncertain diagnosis of an attack, and deciding on privacy settings. <br/>Emerging from this project will be a prototype towards the practice of usable security. The team is working with organizations responsible for the security administration of large enterprise networks and will make the prototype tools available to these organizations. The team is working with everyday users from a cross-section of community members. <br/>Curricular modules that cover the intersection of argumentation and security are being developed and shared.

Abstract: The nascent Science of Security (SoS) seeks to develop the principles with which to understand how computing systems are architected, built, used, and maintained with a view to understanding and addressing security challenges systematically across their life cycle. The Symposium and Bootcamp on the Science of Security (HotSoS), held April 2014 in Raleigh, North Carolina, will help further research in the field. HotSoS is a follow-on to the NSF/NSA-sponsored Science of Security Community meeting held in conjunction with the 2012 SaTC Principal Investigators Meeting. As this is the first year of HotSoS as a separate event, it is difficult to predict attendance, but the organizers are anticipating 150-200 people.<br/><br/>The goal of the travel grant program is to encourage participation in HotSoS by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Availability of student travel grants is publicized through the website and announcements, with particular encouragement for women and underrepresented groups to apply. Preference for awards is given to full-time students with limited other means to support their participation, with priority given to students who are presenting papers at HotSoS.

Abstract: There are at least two key features of the move to cloud computing that introduce the opportunity for significant leaps forward in computer security for tenant services. First, a compute cloud provides a common software, hardware and management basis for rolling out cross-cutting services en masse that have resisted incremental deployment in a one-service-at-a-time fashion. Second, compute clouds offer providers a broad view of activity across an unprecedented diversity of tenant services. This research project leverages these features to develop new approaches to a wide array of fundamental problems in computer security. By convening Cloud Security Horizons summits with industry stakeholders, this project further seeks to both contribute to industry directions in cloud computing and to be informed by them.<br/><br/>Particular longstanding security challenges addressed in this project include secure transport, authorization, user and software authentication, security monitoring, and incident analysis. Moreover, since modern clouds are not sufficiently extensible to support the envisioned capabilities, this project is constructing cloud software platforms that enable the flexibility, extensibility and security needed for this research to come to fruition in practice.

Abstract: The rampant growth of stealthy rootkits poses a serious security <br/>threat to cyberspace. Specifically, with the capability of directly <br/>subverting the software root of trust of a computer system, a rootkit <br/>can surreptitiously take over the control of the system and maintain <br/>a hidden presence thereafter. To effectively defend against them, <br/>researchers have explored various anti-rootkit solutions. Unfortunately, <br/>to our disadvantage, the state-of-the-art defense is mainly reactive <br/>and cannot meet the challenges in the arms-race against them.<br/><br/>This project is developing a systematic immunization approach to <br/>proactively prevent and exterminate rootkit attacks. This goal is <br/>being achieved in three key steps. First, we are developing a fundamental <br/>immunization capability self-nonself discrimination to reliably discern <br/>and prevent malicious rootkit code execution. Second, we are investigating <br/>a kernel shepherding technique to enforce kernel control-flow integrity. <br/>Third, we are designing and implementing a high-assurance hypervisor <br/>with a minimal trusted computing base to establish and sustain the <br/>root-of-trust of the entire computer system. We expect the results <br/>from this research will substantially elevate our defense capability <br/>against elusive rootkits as well as more generic malware. We will <br/>disseminate our results by releasing the tools developed as well as <br/>associated education materials appropriate for undergraduate and <br/>graduate courses and IT staff training in industry and government <br/>agencies.

Abstract: Risk communication is an important part of many cyber security mechanisms. Android's current risk communication mechanism is based on security warnings and has been demonstrated to be ineffective because users become habituated to ignore such warnings and tend to consent to all prompts. This multi-disciplinary research project aims at developing holistic solutions to usable risk communication and control for the Android platform. <br/><br/>This project investigates an approach that presents risk information at multiple granularities, including a high-level numerical risk summary, an intermediate-level summary of risk for different dimensions, and detailed risk information. The high-level risk summary is computed by information integration techniques, using information discovered from multiple sources, e.g., user reviews and app source code. This summary enables proactive risk communication (e.g., when the user searches for apps) so that users can take this information into the decision process. <br/><br/>This project also introduces a multi-mode approach that, in addition to communicating risks, also controls risks in the sense of discouraging risky applications and ensuring that users truly understand the risks. The project develops mechanisms that aggregate, communicate, and control risks incurred by apps at runtime, and ways to personalize risk integration, communicate, and control techniques to accommodate differences among users.<br/><br/>This project is expected to advance the state of the art in principles and techniques to risk communication and control, and has the potential to impact the Android app ecosystem by collaboration with Google researchers.

Abstract: Mobile browsers are beginning to serve as critical enablers of modern computing. With a combination of rich features that rival their desktop counterparts and strong security mechanisms such as TLS/SSL, these mobile browsers are becoming the basis of many other mobile apps. Unfortunately, the security guarantees provided by mobile browsers and the risks associated with today?s mobile web have not been evaluated in great detail. This project investigates the security of mobile browsers, the applications that build on them through APIs such as WebViews and the mobile specific websites they access. This research differs significantly from prior work; whereas previous research has focused largely on stand-alone, third-party applications, our work focuses on mobile browsers and the increasing number of applications using them as their basis for delivering content. Moreover, our work measures the extent to which the mobile web itself is vulnerable. The combination of these efforts aims to create the first longitudinal and principled study of the mobile web ecosystem.

Abstract: Software development is a complex and manual process, in part because typical software programs contain more than hundreds of thousands lines of computer code. If software programmers fail to perform critical checks in that code, such as making sure a user is authorized to update an account, serious security compromises ensue. Indeed, vulnerable software is one of the leading causes of cyber security problems. Checking for security problems is very expensive because it requires examining computer code for security mistakes, and such a process requires significant manual effort. This research project aims at developing an interactive help system to warn software programmers about potential security mistakes, similar to the way modern word processors warn writers of spelling and grammar errors. This is likely lead to new functions for software development tools that will significantly reduce security vulnerabilities in software.<br/><br/>The research is based on the concept of interactive static analysis, a novel mixed-initiative paradigm for interacting with programmers to aid in the detection and prevention of security vulnerabilities. Static analysis is seamlessly integrated into the development environment in such a way that programmers are not required to learn additional programming language and analysis concepts beyond the use of the development environment. Static analysis is performed in the context of development, allowing programmers to utilize and influence such analysis during their program construction. The goals of this research are to bring programmers into the security loop, improving their ability to detect, understand, and prevent vulnerabilities; and utilize the programmer's contextual knowledge to drive customized static analysis, detecting software vulnerabilities that are difficult to detect using current static analysis techniques.

Abstract: Jamming resistance is crucial for applications where reliable wireless communication is required, such as rescue missions and military operations. Spread spectrum technologies such as Frequency Hopping (FH) and Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) have been used as countermeasures against jamming attacks. However, these anti-jamming techniques require that senders and receivers share a secret key in order to communicate with each other. In situations where the adversary can compromise a legitimate communication device and learn the secret key, she can effectively defeat FH or DSSS wireless communication and thus disrupt normal network operations. In general, traditional anti-jamming techniques such as FH and DSSS are vulnerable to insider attacks where the adversary has access to the secret key used for anti-jamming wireless communication. This project develops novel and efficient insider-jamming-resistant techniques for both DSSS and FH-based wireless communication systems. This research consists of two thrusts: The first thrust develops novel spreading/despreading techniques to enhance DSSS-based wireless communication to defend against insider jamming threats, while the second thrust develops a new approach to enable FH-based wireless communication to be resistant against insider jammers. A key property of these new approaches is that they do not depend on any secret shared by the sender and receivers. This project will significantly enhance the resilience of future wireless communication systems, especially those for mission-critical applications that may face potential adversaries (e.g., rescue missions and military operations). The results obtained in this project will be disseminated through publications, graduate-level courses, and public release of software packages.

Abstract: This project is developing new techniques for manipulating sensitive data by exploring two related areas, computing on private keys and computing on authenticated data. Currently, a private key is an inert object that gives its holder the ability to perform a cryptographic operation on all messages, as may be the case when generating a signature. The project is exploring a new vision, in which computing on the private key itself creates new restricted private keys that can only perform restricted operations such as, for example, signing only some messages but not others. In the case of computing on authenticated data -- data for which integrity is important but secrecy is not -- the project is developing new tools to compute on such data and obtain authenticated results.<br/><br/>The project is committed to the dissemination of research results, education of students, and outreach to industry. Overall, the proposed project will produce a next generation of technology for managing authenticated and encrypted data while advancing the field of applied cryptography and educating the next generation of researchers.

Abstract: Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) represent an important computing infrastructure which must be protected from attackers. They are used in a wide variety of applications, including networking routers, satellites, military equipment, and automobiles, among others. The storage of FPGA programming information in memory external to the device creates a natural security weakness which, to date, has primarily been addressed via bitstream encryption. Recent work has shown that bitstream encryption is not impervious to attack and, with sufficient effort, the logical function of some or all of an FPGA design can be determined from a bitstream. This work systematically investigates advanced attacks on FPGA designs and, more importantly, develops sound countermeasures against FPGA design manipulations by determined attackers. To eliminate weaknesses, FPGA security is addressed from a new angle: the use of hardware obfuscation to make the true functionality of an FPGA design nearly indecipherable even if the entire logic-level design can be determined by bitstream reverse engineering. These questions are addressed by first developing a series of search-based computer-aided design tools which can identify security primitives (e.g. crypto primitives) in FPGA design logic-level netlists. As a result of this work, a series of automated tools which allow FPGA circuit designers to obscure the functionality of their subcircuits will be developed. These tools will make malicious design modification significantly more difficult or impossible.

Abstract: A basic security concern inherent to outsourced computating services is guaranteeing the integrity of the information received from the cloud. The concern relates both to outsourced data storage and to the results of outsourced computations. There are several aspects to this problem like ensuring software correctness, protecting against intentional deviation and shortcuts, maintaining data provenance, and guaranteeing results of distributed computation from mutually distrusted sources. Moreover, it is not enough to provide separate guarantees on each axis, solutions to these concerns must compose.<br/><br/>This proposal concentrates on the design of mechanisms that enable clients to verify the correctness of the results of outsourced computations, authenticity and provenance of remotely stored data, and the combination of the two. Particular emphasis is given to mechanisms that provide composable security guarantees, where one can combine the security properties of several individual mechanisms to a joint, holistic security guarantee, and furthermore make informed and meaningful tradeoffs between performance and verifiability. These new abilities are bound to greatly enhance the acceptance and usefulness of cloud computing, and in particular open it up to new classes of applications and markets.

Abstract: Portable storage devices such as USB flash drives have become virtually ubiquitous in daily life. They are as useful to students in college as to a soldier transferring data in a combat theater. However, the security risks posed by using these devices are all too real: after malicious code on a flash drive infected operational networks, allowing a mass exfiltration of classified data subsequently posted to Wikileaks, the Department of Defense banned these devices. The security vulnerabilities exposed by these events are of concern far beyond the military and extend to any user of portable storage. While numerous attempts have been made to secure hosts from malicious devices, very little research has considered the symmetrical problem of ensuring the protection of sensitive data from potentially compromised hosts, nor the security of the USB bus itself.<br/><br/>This project examines the factors contributing to the vulnerability of portable storage devices and consider a new framework for modeling and evaluating the security of these devices. We will consider the security of the storage devices themselves, the hosts they attach to, and the USB interface that transports the data. We consider methods of monitoring the integrity of attached hosts, and examine how to establish and manage host identity. We propose applications based on these devices, such as maintaining provenance and forensic information on stored data, and new frameworks supporting information flow for further enforcing finer-grained access protections. Such advances will ensure that flash drives and hosts they attach to remain safe and secure.

Abstract: To better articulate privacy as a dynamic and dialectic phenomenon in a Web 2.0 world, this project proposes a set of basic empirical research activities to investigate three aspects of privacy in online social networks: conceptualization, intervention, and awareness. The goals of this CAREER award are to: 1) improve the theoretical understanding of information privacy in the context of online social networks in an interdisciplinary manner; 2) assess the efficacy of various privacy intervention strategies developed or proposed by the technologists and regulators; and 3) develop and enhance the persuasiveness of privacy and security awareness and training programs. The main contribution of this research is the generation of an interdisciplinary privacy research framework, with extensive grounding in a range of multidisciplinary privacy literatures in behavioral sciences, computer science, information systems, communication, and social psychology. This research takes a holistic view of privacy compared to the large amount of work focusing strictly on data privacy aspects. Thus, it recognizes the critical importance of user perceptions and behaviors when evaluating and developing privacy protection approaches. The proposed three tasks are greatly needed to better connect the social analysis of user privacy behaviors with the technical design of privacy enhancing technologies. The work should contribute to basic science-the underpinnings of user perceptions and actions around privacy management-as well as the findings generated for informing the design of privacy enhancing techniques. The research findings can enable technology-oriented researchers to develop more feasible privacy enhancing techniques that are embedded into the design specifications of systems, as well as aligned with organizational practices and user behaviors. This project will adopt various empirical research methods (experiments, large-scale survey, focus group and social network analysis) to test the behavioral hypotheses underlying user privacy behaviors in the context of online social networks. Well executed surveys and field experiments will contribute substantially to our understanding of how the actual users of online social networks behave and what interventions (in terms of technologies, regulations and trainings) may change their privacy decisions and behaviors.<br/><br/>One of the three major research thrusts is to develop a privacy awareness and training program for users of online social networks. The findings could potentially have a large impact on promoting privacy and security awareness in the user community. The project also has impacts on guideline creation for industry regulators and government agencies. The PI aims to transform the repository of knowledge on the dynamic and dialectic nature of privacy assurance into a number of educational activities in her academic home at Penn State. The educational plan describes the development of new courses and course modules on privacy assurance at both undergraduate and graduate levels, bringing research into classrooms, outreach to students in underrepresented groups, and training of undergraduate and graduate student researchers in interdisciplinary methods. The PI has transformed her science into a privacy workshop for high-school girls and their parents to teach about on-line privacy issues and practices. She proposes to continue such efforts to promote privacy and security awareness among high-school girls, as well as to attract more female students into the program of security and risk analysis at Penn State. The PI will also work with a professional society, the Association for Information Systems, to create a privacy research chapter and a privacy pedagogy section to extend the Information Systems research agenda and curriculum into this important area nationally.

Abstract: The domain name system (DNS) protocol plays a significant role in operation of the Internet by enabling the bi-directional association of domain names with IP addresses. It is also increasingly abused by malware, particularly botnets, by use of: (1) automated domain generation algorithms for rendezvous with a command-and-control (C&C) server, (2) DNS fast flux as a way to hide the location of malicious servers, and (3) DNS as a carrier channel for C&C communications. This project explores the development of a scalable, hierarchical machine-learning stack, called HIMALAYAS, which specializes in algorithms for automatically mining DNS data for malware activity. In particular, we are interested in isolating both ordered and unordered sets of malware domain groups whose access patterns are temporally and logically correlated. <br/><br/>HIMALAYAS performs a task of increasing complexity at each level - starting from scalable clustering and feature selection at lower levels, to more advanced malware domain subsequence identification algorithms at higher levels. It has multiple benefits, including speed, accuracy, interpretability, and ability to use domain knowledge, which makes it very well suited for malware analysis and related tasks. The analysis by HIMALAYAS should accelerate the identification and takedown of malware domains on the Internet and improve services such as Google SafeSearch. <br/><br/>The machine-learning stack developed as part of the HIMALAYAS project has broader application to many important data mining problems, e.g., in financial data analysis, and mining user patterns from web access logs. The project provides opportunities for students to participate in the development and transition of the technology.

Abstract: This frontier project tackles many of the fundamental research challenges necessary to provide trustworthy information systems for health and wellness, as sensitive information and health-related tasks are increasingly pushed into mobile devices and cloud-based services.

Abstract: The project aims at quantifying a general network's inner potential<br/>for supporting various forms of security by achieving secret common<br/>randomness between pairs or groups of its nodes. Statistical and<br/>computational secrecy measures are being considered against a general<br/>passive adversary. Common-randomness-achieving protocols are classified<br/>into two groups: culture-building and crowd-shielding. The former achieves<br/>common randomness between nodes situated in close proximity of each other,<br/>from correlated observations of specific (natural or induced) network<br/>phenomena. The latter ties together the security of multiple communication<br/>links, to the point where an adversary can no longer isolate and attack<br/>a single link without attacking the group as a whole. The broad range of<br/>investigated protocols cover multiple topics, from multipath diversity<br/>to network tomography, from secure network coding to protocol coding,<br/>and from anonymous routing to the spread of epidemics. The protocols<br/>harvest network randomness from diverse sources like ciphertext blocks<br/>originating at various terminals, contention protocols (delay randomness)<br/>or network topology (in highly-dynamic, or ad-hoc networks).<br/><br/>Communication networks are naturally dynamic, inherently redundant,<br/>and largely unpredictable. While the former two features have long<br/>been recognized as a valuable resource for integrity, efficiency<br/>and confidentiality, network unpredictability is often regarded as an<br/>incommodity. This project shows how network randomness can be harvested,<br/>and, together with diversity, exploited to enhance communication<br/>security. In doing so, it develops a more profound understanding about<br/>the statistical nature of networks, which can be applied to a broad range<br/>of information-assurance objectives. The technical approaches and the<br/>general philosophy developed in this project, and disseminated through<br/>conferences and seminars, have the potential to inspire an abundance of<br/>related research. The project will directly impact dozens of students<br/>through Senior Design projects, a research-and-open-project approach to<br/>curriculum development, and three new graduate courses containing related<br/>topics. The PIs are actively involved in programs aimed at increasing<br/>the involvement of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with<br/>disabilities in engineering and computing sciences.

Abstract: Pairing is a fundamental problem of establishing secure, i.e., authenticated and confidential, connection between two previously unassociated devices over a short-range wireless radio channel. Lack of prior security context or a common trust infrastructure triggers the threat of man-in-the-middle attacks. Addressing this threat necessitates user involvement in the device pairing process. Despite extensive prior research, the pairing problem has not been duly addressed so far. The fundamental difficulty stems from a complete lack of user motivation in the pairing process, which leads to different forms of human errors, undermining the overall security and/or usability of the process.<br/><br/>This project aims to address the problem of secure device pairing via playful user engagement. First, it is investigating the use of a rewarding functionality based on the principles of extrinsic motivation to improve the security and usability of traditional device pairing mechanisms. Second, in order to make secure device pairing fun and enjoyable, it is adopting computer games to facilitate user involvement. In other words, the user would be asked to play a simple game which accomplishes the pairing task as a side effect. Specifically, a suite of playful solutions for device pairing are being designed and prototyped in this project. The project is providing advanced mentoring to many students as well as integrating the proposed research with ongoing security curriculum, enabling participants to acquire rare skills at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, and Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace. It is also facilitating outreach to high school and K-12 students, and minority populations. The prototypes arising from this project have the potential to be deployed in practice, making device pairing not only usable but also pleasurable for day-to-day users.

Abstract: There are at least two key features of the move to cloud computing that introduce the opportunity for significant leaps forward in computer security for tenant services. First, a compute cloud provides a common software, hardware and management basis for rolling out cross-cutting services en masse that have resisted incremental deployment in a one-service-at-a-time fashion. Second, compute clouds offer providers a broad view of activity across an unprecedented diversity of tenant services. This research project leverages these features to develop new approaches to a wide array of fundamental problems in computer security. By convening Cloud Security Horizons summits with industry stakeholders, this project further seeks to both contribute to industry directions in cloud computing and to be informed by them.<br/><br/>Particular longstanding security challenges addressed in this project include secure transport, authorization, user and software authentication, security monitoring, and incident analysis. Moreover, since modern clouds are not sufficiently extensible to support the envisioned capabilities, this project is constructing cloud software platforms that enable the flexibility, extensibility and security needed for this research to come to fruition in practice.

Abstract: This project designs and deploys a multi-disciplinary framework to model spatial, temporal and social dynamics of cyber criminals. The framework fuses theories in both computer science and criminology. Specifically, project objectives are a) Apply and validate existing theories in the realm of general criminology (in particular Akers? social learning theory and Gottfredson and Hirschi?s general theory of crime) to study cyber crimes; b) Derive novel Internet usage features as fingerprints for cyber crimes; c) Design classification algorithms (based on multi-fractal analysis and petri-net designs) to subsequently model multiple dynamics of cyber criminals by integrating theoretical and practical outcomes from the above two objectives; and d) Extensively test and validate project outcomes. The core novelty of this project is in using real Internet data from subjects (initially a cyber savvy college sample) that is collected continuously, unobtrusively, while still preserving a high degree of privacy.<br/><br/><br/>Outcomes of this project will have far reaching impacts. It lays a foundation for fusing expertise in social sciences (specifically criminology) and cyber security, as a result of which existing theories in general criminology can be empirically tested for practical validity in studying cyber crimes. The identification of unique Internet fingerprints associating with cyber crimes will provide new insights into human centered aspects of cyber crimes, which is lacking today. The classification algorithms designed will provide cyber defenders with new tools to combat cyber crimes from multiple perspectives including prevention, detection, forensic investigations and prosecution.

Abstract: Despite the Internet's status as critical infrastructure, there is little scientific instrumentation dedicated to monitoring global Internet behavior. In particular, we have no rigorous framework for measuring, analyzing, or quantifying the impact of network outages, filtering, or other abnormal connectivity dynamics on a global scale.<br/><br/>This project applies successful research results in analyzing recent macroscopic Internet connectivity disruptions to the development, testing, and experimental deployment of an operational capability to detect, monitor, and characterize such large-scale infrastructure outages. The investigators are seeking to validate and extend a methodology for identifying not only which networks have been affected by an outage, but also which mechanisms have been used to effect a deliberate disruption. The two intellectual themes of the research are: (1) extracting signal from malware-induced background radiation in Internet traffic (IBR); and (2) combining multiple types of data (active probing, passive IBR, routing data, geolocation, and registry databases) to delineate the scope and progression of the outage. The project will also develop quantitative indicators to gauge the impact of geophysical disasters on Internet infrastructure, including the dynamics of loss and restoration of service. A transition of these research outcomes into practice will yield a system specification, implementation, and experimental operational deployment to detect and monitor global connectivity failures on a planetary scale. In addition to improving our understanding of how measurements yield insights into network behavior, and strengthening our ability to model large scale complex networks, such a system will illuminate infrastructure vulnerabilities that derive from architectural, topological, or economic constraints, suggesting how to mitigate or eliminate these weaknesses in future Internet architecture and measurement research.

Abstract: This project explores the extent to which personality traits predict privacy and security behaviors. Over the past decade, computer privacy and security have improved by leaps and bounds by considering human factors in the design process. However, previous work to improve the usability of privacy and security systems has only examined the behaviors of "average users," which is believed to only yield local maxima because no individual perfectly fits this profile. Therefore, this project is examining the extent to which additional improvements can be made by catering system designs to individual differences (e.g., in personality traits). Through a series of surveys and controlled experiments, researchers are discovering how these personality traits are predictive of certain privacy decisions, as well as interactions with various security mitigations. For instance, knowledge of a user's personality traits may result in more appropriate default privacy settings on a social networking website or web browser security warnings that are more salient to that user. The researchers' goal is to ultimately design systems that infer personality traits and then adjust privacy and security mechanisms so as to yield outcomes that are optimally aligned with a particular user's preferences.

Abstract: The main research focus of this proposal is to create a platform that allows to automatically find attacks in unmodified binaries of distributed systems. The attacks are conducted through message manipulation by insider attackers and impact primarily performance and availability. The platform combines existent open-source virtualization environments such as KVM, and network simulation and emulation tools such as NS3, to create a realistic environment in which target systems will run. The platform is general, scalable, and can be used for testing a large variety of distributed systems such as intrusion-tolerant and peer-to-peer systems.<br/><br/>The platform will improve the trust that distributed systems work according to their intended specifications in spite of faults, misconfigurations, or attacks.<br/>The platform can serve as a tool for system developers from industry, government labs, and academia to test their systems. In addition, it can be used for programing exercises for distributed systems and computer security courses at both undergraduate and graduate level.

Abstract: Information technology, advances in statistical computing, and the deluge of data available through the Internet are transforming computational social science. However, a major challenge is maintaining the privacy of human subjects. This project is a broad, multidisciplinary effort to help enable the collection, analysis, and sharing of sensitive data while providing privacy for individual subjects. Bringing together computer science, social science, statistics, and law, the investigators seek to refine and develop definitions and measures of privacy and data utility, and design an array of technological, legal, and policy tools for dealing with sensitive data. In addition to contributing to research infrastructure around the world, the ideas developed in this project will benefit society more broadly as it grapples with data privacy issues in many other domains, including public health and electronic commerce.<br/><br/>This project will define and measure privacy in both mathematical and legal terms, and explore alternate definitions of privacy that may be more general or more practical. The project will study variants of differential privacy and develop new theoretical results for use in contexts where it is currently inappropriate or impractical. The research will provide a better understanding of the practical performance and usability of a variety of algorithms for analyzing and sharing privacy-sensitive data. The project will develop secure implementations of these algorithms and legal instruments, which will be made publicly available and used to enable wider access to privacy-sensitive data sets at the Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Science's Dataverse Network.

Abstract: Maintaining the security of one's systems and devices in a way that ensures the right balance between functionality, security, and convenience remains complicated for most people. For example, people are routinely asked by their systems whether to accept a security certificate, install an application, heed security warnings, or reconfigure operating-system security settings. While these examples represent situations in which people regularly find themselves, people rarely have any basis to make an informed decision or to establish one conveniently. This research examines the concept of 'crowdsourced security' where the solution lies in people leveraging members of their community to secure their systems and devices.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this research is to determine the potential of crowdsourcing as a complementary strategy for enhancing security. An example challenge addressed in this research pertains to the security of one's personal data. Specifically the research seeks to develop security mechanisms that can exploit naturally occurring social relationships and utilize 'human computation' to shift the burden of security via authentication from machines to humans. Within this framework, the research investigates both questions about the technical effectiveness of crowdsourced security solutions, as well as socio-behavioral questions about users' preferences, motivations, and privacy concerns about such systems. This research will benefit society by producing a deeper understanding of how systems can be better secured through human participation and collaboration, moving beyond the status quo of current security mechanisms.

Abstract: As society becomes more dependent on cyber infrastructure, the security of networks and information technologies has become a growing concern. Individuals, businesses, and governmental organizations are now common victims of cyber-attacks that seek to steal private data, gain remote control over remote systems, and cause harm to networks and systems through other malicious means. Additionally, critical infrastructures such as smart power grids and communication networks are facing an increasing number of cyber-based threats. As a result, many researchers and security practitioners have begun to investigate cyber attacker communities in order to learn more about cyber attacker behaviors, emerging threats, and the cybercriminal supply chain. Unfortunately, there is a lack of established science for cyber security research. The lack of literature is problematic for researchers wanting to learn more so that they may contribute to and advance the current state of cyber security research. For example, many cyber attacker communities take careful measures to hide themselves by employing anti-crawling measures. This would be a challenge for many researchers and security practitioners. Furthermore, some may find cyber attacker community discussion difficult to interpret due to cyber attacker jargon, advanced security concepts, or foreign contents belonging to cyber attacker groups spanning across different countries or regions.<br/><br/>For these reasons, research studying hacker communities is greatly needed, as well as research that advances others? capacity to understand and investigate contents from such communities. Specifically, the development of automated tools and analyses increases the potential for more cyber security research. Web mining and machine learning technologies can be used in tandem with social science methodologies to help answer many questions related to hacker behaviors and culture, illegal markets and covert networks, cybercriminal supply chain, malware analysis, emerging security threats, and other matters. There are many opportunities for extending current cyber security research by combining hacker community data with social science methodologies, computational techniques, and security analysis. <br/><br/>In this research, important questions about hacker behaviors, markets, community structure, community contents, artifacts, and cultural differences are explored. Automated techniques to collect and analyze data from forums, Internet Relay Chat, and honeypots will be developed. The development of such tools will help further proactive approaches for preventing cyber-based threats, rather than taking the traditional approach of reacting when something "bad" happens. Better understanding of hacker communities across multiple geopolitical regions will support a better understanding of cybercriminal behavior, and improved and safer practices for security researchers and practitioners.<br/><br/>The proposed integrated computational framework and the resulting algorithms and software will also allow social science researchers and security practitioners to closely examine how cyber attacker groups form, develop, and spread their ideas; identify important and influential cyber criminals in the online world; and develop the means to recognize online hacker identities through their communication and interaction styles. Knowing more about cyber criminals, hackers, and their illegal black markets can help policy makers and security professionals make better decisions about how to prevent or respond to attacks. <br/><br/>The proposed work also contributes to the educational and professional development of the student research associates who contribute to it. They will learn sound research methods, and how to write about and present their work for scientific and other professional audiences.

Abstract: Traditional security authorization decisions are black and white: a user either satisfies a particular access policy or does not. This rigidity is a handicap in our complex and unpredictable world. As a result, even security-conscious organizations typically grossly overprovision principals with access rights and/or underconstrain access policies to ensure that principals can always carry out the organization's mission effectively and respond to unexpected opportunities and challenges. This project focuses on developing dynamic and risk-aware approaches to access control that allow organizations to make security-critical decisions in the face of incomplete information and unexpected circumstances. This is accomplished by combining proof-theoretic access controls with economic models of risk. In the event that the expected proof of authorization for an action cannot be generated, the systems developed in this project carry out an efficient search for similar proofs of authorization that minimize the overall risk incurred by deviating from the expected. This approach allows policies to adapt dynamically to the changing context of the systems in which they are deployed. This research will have several benefits, including increased system availability during disasters or other uncommon cases not explicitly modeled by policies; reduced instances of permission creep, as overprovisioning users is no longer required to ensure that an organization's business needs are met; a quantifiable means of assessing how policies are actually used and how they might be changed to better reflect the evolution of organizations; and the development of metrics for assessing access control risks.

Abstract: Recently we have seen the emergence new challenges to cyber security in which adversaries seek, not to simply to deny service, steal data, or utilize resources, but rather to use the network to distort information to influence opinion, thought, or action. Such Internet information manipulation is challenging in that the scale of the Internet makes it easier to influence large numbers of users, that the anonymity on the Internet makes attribution and identity hard, and that the control of information flow is distributed and highly automated allowing for easy modification of personalization and filtering algorithms.<br/><br/>This research project proposes to study information manipulation on the Internet. Specifically, it seeks to provide evidence of manipulation and demonstrate the serious nature of the problem. The project has three parts: (1) Constructing a corpus of documented cases of Internet information manipulation, (2) An identification of various players in Internet information flow and their relationships to each other, and (3) An empirical analysis of the scope of the information flow between these players. More broadly, the work will provide data to inform techniques, and methods that with enhance a truly interdisciplinary set of fields, from the social and political sciences, to networking and distributed systems, security, information retrieval, and data mining.

Abstract: This project addresses several key emerging security challenges that arise due to the wildly successful large-scale adoption of mobile devices with diverse network capabilities. The novel approach focuses on to understanding how various information that are legitimately and willingly provided by smartphone users due to the requested permissions of downloaded applications can be potentially abused. The second research focus is to identify improvements in the design of cellular network middlebox (e.g., firewall) policies by detailed exposure and explicitly defining the key requirements. Using insights from the two research thrusts, support to detect abuse of network resources by mobile devices is explored, leveraging both existing mechanisms and new improvements for evaluation. There are three key areas of technical contributions from this project: (1) Investigation of the construction of cellular botnets from non-traditional means, (2) Discovery of the deficiency of cellular network policies to resource abuse and targeted attacks, and (3) Misbehavior detection of mobile devices in abusing infrastructure resources to gain unfair advantages in network and energy usage.<br/><br/>This project will have significant and broad impact on both the networking security community and our society, as effective reliance on mobile devices for information access is rapidly growing and security assurance of cellular data network infrastructure is critical to achieving robust and highly available mobile networks and network services. Any software developed in this work will be available to the research community and the network operator community. Associated experimental tools and specific experimental configurations will be released through web venues.

Abstract: This project tackles the social and economic elements of Internet security: how the motivations and interactions of attackers, defenders, and users shape the threats we face, how they evolve over time, and how they can best be addressed. While security is a phenomenon mediated by the technical workings of computers and networks, it is ultimately a conflict driven by economic and social issues that merit a commensurate level of scrutiny. Today's online attackers are commonly profit-seeking, and the implicit social networks that link them together play a critical role in fostering the innovation and the efficiency underlying cybercrime markets. Further, the socio-economic lens can provide vital insights not only for understanding attackers, but victims too. Today's consumers, corporations, and governments make large investments in security technology with little understanding of their ultimate return-on-investment. And the ease with which we adopt online personas and relationships has created a collective blind spot that attackers exploit all-too-easily.<br/><br/>Grappling with these socio-economic dimensions is of fundamental importance for achieving a secure future information infrastructure, and developing a sound understanding of them requires research grounded in empiricism. Accordingly, the project has four key components: (1) pursue in-depth empirical analyses of a range of online criminal activities; (2) map out the evolving attacker ecosystem that preys on online social networks, and the extent to which unsafe online behavior is itself adopted and transmitted; (3) study how relationships among these criminals are established, maintained, and evolve over time; and (4) measure the efficacy of today's security interventions, both in the large and at the level of individual users. Across all of these efforts, the aim is to identify bottleneck elements where interventions might most effectively undermine entire ecosystems of abusive and criminal activities. Consequently, this research has the potential to dramatically benefit society by undermining entire cybercrime ecosystems: disrupting underground activities, infrastructure, and social networks through strategic intervention. The work will also create numerous educational opportunities, including undergraduate and graduate education as well as workforce education for security professionals, law enforcement, civil regulatory agencies, and legal scholars and professionals tasked with countering modern Internet threats.

Abstract: This research advances the knowledge and capability for securely<br/>performing general-purpose computation and communication on zero-power<br/>devices that rely on harvested energy stored in extremely small<br/>reservoirs such as capacitors. A type of zero-power device,<br/>computational RFIDs (CRFIDs) harvest RF energy and endure continual<br/>interruptions to power. Complete loss of RAM on the order of every<br/>second makes the notion of a computational checkpoint fundamental to<br/>this model of computing. A significant problem is how to perform<br/>effective computation and checkpoints in a secure and<br/>privacy-preserving manner. The most fundamental question is: how to<br/>securely make forward progress of computation on zero-power devices?<br/>The exploration of checkpointing strategies that exploit the<br/>energy-centric properties of computational RFIDs will lay a solid<br/>foundation for designing secure software and systems for pervasive<br/>devices. Beyond security and privacy, the research seeks to discover<br/>what kinds of computational problems can be solved in a practical<br/>sense on extremely resource-constrained devices. While the<br/>experiments focus on computational RFIDs, many of the techniques will<br/>apply broadly to devices with batteries as well.<br/><br/>The impact of this work will lead to improved security for computation<br/>in low-power, untrusted infrastructure. The expected results will be<br/>published in venues at the intersection of security & privacy and<br/>low-power computation. Potential applications include improved<br/>security and privacy for (1) implantable medical devices and (2)<br/>sensors embedded in concrete components of bridges and roads.

Abstract: This project examines three properties of underground cybercrime communities: 1) profitability, 2) connectivity, 3) and sustainability. It identifies qualitative and quantitative metrics for these properties as well as discusses the relative effectiveness of distinct operationalization of these metrics under different levels of data granularity. The goal is to develop metrics that provide meaning indicators even when data is limited. for example, if public posts are available but not private messages between individual cybercriminals. The analysis targets five underground forums: AntiChat, BadHacke, BlackhatWorld, Carders, and L33tCrew. Finally, the project combines linguistic techniques, e.g. topic modeling, social network analysis, and analysis to provide a repeatable, verifiable, and systematic framework that enables a scientific exploration of these forums and the impact of distinct interventions at mitigating underground forums. <br/><br/>This project assumes that cybercrime is made economically feasible by collaboration between criminals with specialized skills, as facilitated by underground forums. Thus, it argues to change the fundamental focus of anti-cybercrime efforts from making individual incidence of cybercrime unprofitable to making cybercrime communities unsustainable. The findings inform defender efforts, both for academic researchers as well as practitioners. The project builds a scientific framework to evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions. This framework is being used to develop tools for law enforcement as well as pedagogical material to educate students in cyber-security.

Abstract: As the use of Web applications has increased, malicious content and cyber attacks are rapidly increasing in both their frequency and their sophistication. For unwary users and their organizations, social media sites such as Tumblr, Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, and LinkedIn pose a variety of serious security risks and threats. Recent studies show that social media sites are more in use for delivering malware than were previously popular methods of email delivery. Because of this, many organizations are looking for ways to implement effective security policies. Getting employees to comply with a security policy, however, can be a significant challenge. <br/><br/>Studies show that the weakest link in a security chain is users. Thus, organizations need to find innovative methods to increase their employees' security awareness and their capabilities to engage in online security behavior. This project aims to study the factors that affect cyber security behavior, and use customized and evidence-based malware reports and e-learning materials to help employees more deeply understand their security risks and to improve their security behavior. The first stage of this project will be a large-scale survey study to identify key factors that affect organizational employees' security behavior. These data will be used to develop a psychological decision-making model for cyber security compliance. The second stage of this project will be a controlled experimental study to compare the effectiveness of different evidence-based interventions designed to increase employees' cyber security compliance. <br/><br/>This project will contribute to the understanding of cyber security behaviors of employees and the development of more effective cyber security policies. The developed model will explain and predict how various factors affect employees' cyber security behaviors. Project results will contribute to the psychological, behavioral, and educational theories relating to the basic processes by which people assess vulnerabilities and threats, choose adaptive or maladaptive coping strategies, and adopt new coping strategies. Through educational workshops, a project portal, journal publications, and conference presentations, the results of the project will reach a broad audience that includes corporate IT directors, managers, employees, researchers and practitioners in various industries such as real estate, financial services, logistics and supply chain, insurance and education.

Abstract: Cyber security is increasingly seen as the management of economic trade-offs: balancing losses from actual attacks (e.g., monetary costs, psychological costs due to loss of privacy, etc.) against the costs of threat/attack mitigation mechanisms (e.g., monetary costs, degradation of performance and productivity, etc.). While tackling this multi-attribute decision problem in a highly dynamic and uncertain environment, individuals frequently diverge from rationality. To better understand the deviation from rational behavior and to find effective ways to remediate this (when necessary), a systematic study will be undertaken with the results used to model the human behavior of malicious actors (attackers), non-malicious actors - those who intend to maintain the security of a system (defenders) and actors whose behavior/attitudes are indifferent to system security, but do not intend to attack the system (end users).<br/><br/>The research methodology involves: (1) generating representative scenarios of various attack / mitigation decision problems, (2) conducting surveys using scenario simulations to identify the drivers of human behavior relative to each scenario, (3) developing models of human behavior that involve the application of various normative and descriptive models from behavioral economics, (4) comparing the outcomes of the models, (5) conducting controlled laboratory experiments with human subjects to reveal differences between predicted and observed user behavior, (6) using the developed models to help determine what measures can be employed to change human behavior, and (7) implementing, simulating, and evaluating the developed models in a multi-agent system.<br/><br/>The project has three key tasks:<br/><br/>(1) Explore what factors drive an adversary to select a particular cyber-attack and what motivates the benign user to either take or not take action. The proposed research also will examine what steps can be taken to change human behavior - either to not attack, take certain attack paths, or, for a benign user, take steps to avoid or mitigate an attack.<br/><br/>(2) Explore the potential difference between optimal and actual security decisions, to determine when and why deviation from the optimal decision occurs, and identify effective means to correct deviations from rationality that impede the realization of good security outcomes.<br/><br/>(3) Investigate how attackers can take advantage of the gap between perceived and actual risk, as well as attackers? risk taking behavior. This is critical to ensuring the development and implementation of effective monitoring and mitigation technologies.<br/><br/>The research will develop techniques and models delivering the foundation for future security-focused behavioral modeling research, provide much needed empirical data, and produce a software toolkit for developing, testing and evaluating methods and models to study human security decision-making.

Abstract: Approximately six million Americans are targets of identity theft each year. Many of the attacks on identity privacy use psychological influence strategies ("psychological attacks?) to induce individuals to provide their private information. Although people are appropriately concerned about their privacy, they often unnecessarily disclose information that could be used to their disadvantage. Our studies have shown that people?s privacy exposure behaviors may be severely affected by psychological attacks. Unfortunately, research from a psychological perspective to mitigate the attacks is scarce. This research identifies critical aspects of warnings for a sub-set of psychological cyber-attacks on privacy and provides guidelines for developing effective mitigations against other types of psychological cyber-attacks. We create computer-mediated countermeasures. We also ascertain the extent to which the warnings capture attention, are understood, are memorable, increase perceptions of risk, decrease trust, and lead to compliance under conditions of psychological attacks. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit. This research is a first investigation of whether theoretical models developed to reduce risky behaviors (e.g., health-related behaviors) can be extended to the domain of computer privacy. The research determines whether warnings can have significant impact on people?s decisions about disclosure of their private information. The effectiveness of our mitigation approach is tested on hand-held devices and web sites with the goal of increasing compliance with the warnings. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts. This research provides mitigation strategies for private information exposure and provides guidelines for software developers to use when designing privacy preserving software. Potentially, the results can be generalized to mitigate other current and future psychological privacy attacks. Research findings are disseminated in both social psychology and computer science. In addition, a website is developed to share the research results, the data sets, and the lessons learned, in order to raise the awareness of the importance of protecting identity information and mitigating psychological cyber-attacks.

Abstract: While policy interest and empirical research on cyber attacks have both increased substantially in recent years, very little attention has been focused on the local ecology of actively operating computer networks. In the research proposed we focus on a bazaar computing environment (i.e. weakly fortified computer networks where a wide variety of users engage in a range of activities with minimal security in largely unregulated settings) and seek to answer three broad research questions: (1) can users within bazaar environments be educated to engage in less risky on-line behavior? (2) can hackers within bazaar environments be deterred through available options? and (3) if users can be educated and hackers can be deterred what is the optimal environment in which IT management can maximize education of users and deterrence of hackers within weakly fortified environments? The proposed research represents a collaboration between criminologists, psychologists, and computer security experts and will evaluate criminological theories within cyberspace using, in addition to survey data and experimental design, detailed network and target computer data drawn from the real time operation of an organization network. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit <br/>A major goal of this project is to move toward a new integrated social science perspective on cybercrime. The pathway to such integration is through the social ecology of a local computing environment. The research proposed here, which simultaneously examines the characteristics of users-victims, offenders-hackers and the computing environment where they interact, will provide a rare opportunity to integrate these situational components. In addition to providing new insights into criminology theory, the proposed research will provide detailed information on the interaction of hackers and users within the context of a weakly fortified computing environment.<br/><br/>Broader Impact <br/>We believe that our ecological approach to cyber security will offer useful insights for ways of improving online security by identifying those system configurations that discourage victim behaviors that are especially likely to result in attacks and deter attackers from malicious activities. Bringing information together from potential victims and offenders within the world of an operating computer environment will allow the development of more efficient safety programs and strategies and has the potential to increase the security of computer systems and strengthen users' confidence and trust in their systems and the cyber environment more generally.

Abstract: Risk communication is an important part of many cyber security mechanisms. Android's current risk communication mechanism is based on security warnings and has been demonstrated to be ineffective because users become habituated to ignore such warnings and tend to consent to all prompts. This multi-disciplinary research project aims at developing holistic solutions to usable risk communication and control for the Android platform. <br/><br/>This project investigates an approach that presents risk information at multiple granularities, including a high-level numerical risk summary, an intermediate-level summary of risk for different dimensions, and detailed risk information. The high-level risk summary is computed by information integration techniques, using information discovered from multiple sources, e.g., user reviews and app source code. This summary enables proactive risk communication (e.g., when the user searches for apps) so that users can take this information into the decision process. <br/><br/>This project also introduces a multi-mode approach that, in addition to communicating risks, also controls risks in the sense of discouraging risky applications and ensuring that users truly understand the risks. The project develops mechanisms that aggregate, communicate, and control risks incurred by apps at runtime, and ways to personalize risk integration, communicate, and control techniques to accommodate differences among users.<br/><br/>This project is expected to advance the state of the art in principles and techniques to risk communication and control, and has the potential to impact the Android app ecosystem by collaboration with Google researchers.

Abstract: As the frequency and complexity of cyber attacks increase, approaches to create secure computing environments must look beyond technical barriers that protect from the outside to building a collaborative culture of cyber health from the inside. Use of online incentives have been shown to be an effective tool for enhancing an individual's engagement with a task. This project explores the use of online incentives and social networking to improve an organization's cyber health by coalescing the micro cyber behaviors of individuals within the organization to create a more secure computing environment. Schools represent an ideal setting in which to test such a new model for cybersecurity. Teachers, faculty and parents are motivated to keep students safe and secure. Further, most students today are very technologically savvy, which introduces technology as an ideal means by which to teach students about cyber risks and how to avoid those risks--and to reinforce good cyber behaviors while reducing bad behaviors. <br/><br/>This project approaches the school as a system in which cybersecurity is improved and maintained through the use of digitally-mediated interventions that combine online psychological incentives for student engagement and social networking to reinforce social and authority figure influences. In short, the project broadly aims to "build cybersecurity in" by engaging multiple stakeholders to help build a more robust public cyber health system. The effectiveness of incentives in building collective cybersecurity awareness and reinforcing positive cyber behaviors is being explored through intervention experiments that are implemented in three student populations: 1) elementary school students who are being exposed to supervised use of digital devices, both in a school environment and at home, for the first time; 2) middle school students who are "experimental" users of digital devices and have limited awareness of cybersecurity concepts; and 3) college students who have been shown to demonstrate risky cyber behaviors that often put them and other university stakeholders at risk. <br/><br/>Recent success in school-based public health interventions to modify personal health behavior informs the project's approach to building public cyber health. In particular, the well-known Health Belief Model provides a lens for exploring how individuals balance belief in their susceptibility to a cyber threat against their belief in the effectiveness of the proposed mitigating behavior when deciding whether to adopt that behavior. However, there are important differences between public health and cybersecurity. Online incentives, used in public health in particular, have been shown to be most effective in modifying behaviors that individuals already know they should perform and that they already know how to perform. This research will explore whether interventions delivered through digital devices can be successful in both changing an individual's current risky behavior and introducing new safe behaviors, at various ages. To assess the impact of the interventions, throughout the study data will be collected on individuals' cybersecurity knowledge, perceptions and behaviors using surveys and by monitoring intervention experiments. <br/><br/>If successful, the novel public cyber health interventions developed in this project will provide benefits that cascade over the long-term to businesses that hire participating students, additional organizations that adopt the intervention techniques, and the broader cyber community. In the near term, this project will directly benefit student participants, as well as teachers and parents, by improving their cybersecurity knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors, thus reducing their risks. Thereafter, the techniques developed will be made widely available for use by other schools and organizations, and as individuals become more secure, the project's impacts have the potential to be further amplified by participants' security behaviors outside of the organizational environment. Further, specific at-risk groups are being targeted in the study?two of the student populations participating provide unique challenges to our research as well as unique rewards if our research is successful. The elementary school population will be drawn from a charter school composed exclusively of minority youth in North Carolina that face significant social, economic, and educational challenges. The middle school partner, located in a rural, economically-challenged eastern North Carolina, is struggling to provide the technical skills that its students need to succeed in the wider global economy.

Abstract: How does the average user cope with the threats they encounter while engaged in the most sensitive of all online activities, online banking? Online Safety for the Ages (OSA) examines generational differences in motivations to use risky online services and self-protective measures in the context of online banking. An influx of older adults attracted to the Internet by social media but at times unfamiliar with dealing with the hazards of online life, as well as younger users who are sometimes oblivious to those dangers, pose distinct challenges to the preservation of online safety.<br/><br/>A partnership with the Michigan State University Federal Credit Union will provide access to both users and non-users of online banking services of various ages to explore these issues. OSA will work from group interviews and observations of users in their homes to understand the risks that ordinary users perceive when attempting to use online banking, how they cope with risks currently, and the gaps that they see in their own abilities to bank safely online. In-depth analysis of surveys administered to credit union customers will reveal the factors that drive and the barriers that prevent adoption of online banking and online consumer safety measures. Finally, OSA will create and test online tutorials designed to help credit union customers become more confident in their abilities to protect themselves while banking online and to understand how their banking institution can assist them.<br/><br/>Thus, OSA will contribute new knowledge about how to motivate average users to play their part in making the Internet safer for themselves and for the online community at large. In public discussions of online security, user education is often mentioned as a priority, but too often only in passing, and with self-canceling lamentations about the difficulty of achieving it. The present project will contribute by developing scientifically grounded, evidenced-based knowledge about effective approaches to consumer education. The project focuses on a vulnerable group of older Americans whose lives can be improved through secure access to financial services. Older Americans, however, are also vulnerable to online scammers and are too often uninformed about online dangers and inexperienced with effective protections. OSA provides a model through which bank customers and their financial institutions can work together to improve online security, a model that will be disseminated widely in the banking community with the assistance of a banking industry partner and to the computer security community through professional publications. Finally, the project will support doctoral students who will pursue careers in academia and government and further the goal of online safety through their own students and constituents.

Abstract: As the use of Web applications has increased, malicious content and cyber attacks are rapidly increasing in both their frequency and their sophistication. For unwary users and their organizations, social media sites such as Tumblr, Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, and LinkedIn pose a variety of serious security risks and threats. Recent studies show that social media sites are more in use for delivering malware than were previously popular methods of email delivery. Because of this, many organizations are looking for ways to implement effective security policies. However, for many organizations, getting employees to comply with a security policy can be a significant challenge. <br/><br/>Studies show that the weakest link in a security chain is user. Thus, organizations need to find innovative methods to increase their employees? security awareness and their capabilities to engage in online security behavior. This project aims to study the factors that affect cyber security behavior, and use customized and evidence-based malware reports and e-learning materials to help employees more deeply understand their security risks and to improve their security behavior. The first stage of this project will be a large-scale survey study to identify key factors that affect organizational employees? security behavior. These data will be used to develop a psychological decision-making model for cyber security compliance. The second stage of this project will be a controlled experimental study to compare the effectiveness of different evidence-based interventions designed to increase employees? cyber security compliance. <br/><br/>This project will contribute to the understanding of cyber security behaviors of employees and the development of more effective cyber security policies. The developed model will explain and predict how various factors affect employees? cyber security behaviors. Project results will contribute to the psychological, behavioral, and educational theories relating to the basic processes by which people assess vulnerabilities and threats, choose adaptive or maladaptive coping strategies, and adopt new coping strategies. Through educational workshops, project portal, journal publications, and conference presentations, the results of the project will reach a broad audience that includes corporate IT directors, managers, employees, researchers and practitioners in various industries such as real estate, financial services, logistics & supply chain, insurance and education.

Abstract: In the last ten years virtual machines (VMs) have been extensively used for security-related applications, such as intrusion detection systems, malicious software (malware) analyzers and secure logging and replay of system execution. A VM is high-level software designed to emulate a computer's hardware. In the traditional usage model, security solutions are placed in a VM layer, which has complete control of the system resources. The guest operating system (OS) is considered to be easily compromised by malware and runs unaware of virtualization. The cost of this approach is the semantic gap problem, which hinders the development and widespread deployment of virtualization-based security solutions: there is significant difference between the state observed by the guest OS (high level semantic information) and by the VM (low level semantic information). The guest OS works on abstractions such as processes and files, while the VM can only see lower-level abstractions, such as CPU and main memory. To obtain information about the guest OS state these virtualization solutions use a technique called introspection, by which the guest OS state is inspected from the outside (VM layer), usually by trying build a map of the OS layout to an area of memory where these solutions can analyze it. We propose a new way to perform introspection, by having the guest OS, traditionally unaware of virtualization, actively collaborate with a VM layer underneath it by requesting services and communicating data and information as equal peers in different levels of abstraction. Our approach allows for stronger and more fine-grained and flexible security approaches to be developed and it is no less secure than the traditional model, as introspection tools also depend on the OS data and code to be untampered to report correct results.<br/><br/><br/>We will design, implement and make available to the research community this collaborative architecture between a guest OS and a VM layer and employ such architecture to counter various types of kernel-level malware. The goal is to increase the cost for attackers by refining trust/integrity values for subjects and objects at OS/VM layers by leveraging social trust. In this architecture guest OS and a VM actively collaborate requesting services and exchanging data and information through special instructions protected from tampering. This will open up possibilities for malware analysis and defense that are not currently possible (due to the semantic gap problem) including, preventing the actions from privacy-invasion malware like keyloggers, mitigating certain types of DoS attacks in the kernel and return-oriented rootkits, increasing the costs for attackers by leveraging social trust to refine integrity levels and restrict systems resources based on them, just to name a few. This research will also lead to the creation of a cyber security laboratory at Bowdoin, a liberal arts college located in Maine.

Abstract: The security of cryptographic tasks is formally defined by precisely specifying the physical assumptions regarding the attack model, and cryptographic protocols are proven secure based on well-defined computational intractability assumptions. Understanding what the minimal computational and physical assumptions are for secure cryptographic protocols is of central importance to this study which will address the following problems:<br/>1. New Barriers for Computational Assumptions: There exists a large body of work on, so-called, black-box separations aiming at elucidating when a cryptographic task cannot be based on a particular computational assumption using certain black-box proof techniques. However, many known constructions and proofs of security do not fall into the framework of such techniques, and as such it is not clear to what extent such separations represent a real barrier. One of the principal goals of this proposal is to develop a framework for providing non-black-box separations between cryptographic tasks and assumptions. <br/>2. New Barriers for Physical Assumptions: Formal definitions of security make explicit assumptions about how the adversary can access or modify information exchanged during a cryptographic process. Traditionally, it is assumed that the attacker participates in a single execution of a protocol, does not get to see the internal state of honest parties, and does not get to tamper with the internal state of honest parties. Recent work has focused on relaxing the first two assumptions. Another principal goal of this proposal is to investigate to what extent the third physical assumption regarding tampering may be weakened.<br/><br/><br/>Progress in this area could have broad impacts on barriers not only in cryptography but also computational complexity and secure systems. The research focusing on physical assumptions bears a promise to have broader impacts on hardware design. The results of this work will be widely disseminated via conferences, journals, workshops, and invited talks, and incorporated into the PI graduate courses.

Abstract: The Workshop on Security and Human Behavior (SHB) was started in 2008 to facilitate a dialogue about behavioral aspects of safety and security that is developing between psychologists and security engineers. Related conferences include the Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) which brings together security people and psychologists but is more narrowly focused on the usability of security products and systems. The Workshop on the Economics of Information Security (WEIS) has much broader scope but as its name suggests its focus is security and economics. The goal of SHB is to bring in a broader set of social scientists than those involved in SOUPS, WEIS, and similar conferences, with a 50/50 mix between social scientists and computer scientists.<br/><br/>This grant provides financial support to cover travel, accommodation and registration for students and social science faculty members, allowing expansion of access to workshop scheduled to be held at University of Southern California's National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events (CREATE - www.usc.edu/create) on June 3-4 2013. Past workshops have been hosted at MIT, Cambridge, MA (2008 and 2009), Cambridge, UK (2010), CMU, Pittsburgh, PA (2011), and Google HQ, New York (2012). The program committee of this year's workshop consists of (1) Bruce Schneier who is Chief Security Technology Officer of BT, (2) Professor Alessandro Acquisti of Carnegie Melon, and (3) Professor Ross Anderson of Cambridge.

Abstract: he goal of this CAREER project is to develop novel mechanisms that use<br/>transactions to improve software assurance. This project is developing<br/>Transactional Memory Introspection---or TMI, which is an approach to <br/>building software security mechanisms by leveraging recent advances in <br/>hardware and software transactional memory. Security mechanisms based <br/>on TMI build upon the same machinery that transactional memory systems <br/>use to ensure performance and functionality. TMI therefore promises to <br/>make security mechanisms efficient and easy to integrate with software.<br/><br/>TMI-based security mechanisms being researched in this project include:<br/>(1) TxAuth: a reference monitor architecture to better ensure complete<br/>mediation of security-sensitive operations and allow easier integration <br/>with legacy systems;<br/>(2) TxInt: a data structure integrity monitor to protect extensible <br/>software systems, such as operating systems and browsers, from untrusted <br/>extensions; and<br/>(3) TMWatch: a data watchpoint framework that equips malware analysis <br/>tools and debuggers with new capabilities to reverse-engineer malware <br/>behavior.<br/><br/>More broadly, this project seeks to demonstrate that concurrency control<br/>machinery implemented in transactional memory systems can also be used to <br/>improve software assurance. These additional benefits may lead to more <br/>research on transactions and their ultimate adoption by hardware and <br/>software vendors. The results from this project are being disseminated <br/>via the development of new course material that will expose students and <br/>software vendors to the dos and don'ts of secure programming. Suitable <br/>course material developed in this project is also being included in <br/>courses targeted towards K-12 and undergraduate students to attract<br/>them to computer science programs.

Abstract: Mobile devices such as smartphones, netbooks and laptops are increasingly beginning to store vast amounts of personal information, such as email, friend lists, current location, and passwords to online banking websites. They are therefore swiftly becoming prized bounties for malicious entities. This project is investigating new techniques to detect malicious software on mobile devices. <br/><br/>This project is investigating three key thrusts (1) energy-aware malware detection, (2) malware detector protection using a new hardware architecture called Limited Local Memory, and (3) collaborative mobile malware detection in a social network environment. The first thrust develops a framework to quantitatively investigate how the energy-constrained nature of mobile devices impacts their ability to run malware detection tools. It is then using the framework to explore energy-aware malware detection. The second thrust explores how emerging multicore technology on smartphones can be usefully leveraged for security if each core is equipped with a small amount of private memory. The third trend explores how the convergence of smartphones and social networking can enable better malware detection.<br/><br/>The primary contribution of the project is in acknowledging the need for novel approaches for mobile malware detection. As we increasingly rely on our smartphones to support our daily activities, their security becomes paramount. The outcomes of the project are being disseminated to increase public awareness of mobile malware and anti-malware. In addition, course material related to the project will be incorporated into the Master's degree curriculum at Rutgers.

Abstract: Pervasive computing, such as sensors in smartphones, buildings, automobiles and cities, result in increased sharing of sensor data, whether initiated by users or by other authorities such as service providers, government entities, interest groups, and individuals. Embedded in this data is information which others, even using sophisticated data mining algorithms, can fuse to construct a virtual biography of our activities, revealing private behaviors and lifestyle patterns. Researchers in this project are devising computational methods to let users exercise privacy control over their personal sensory data that is shared.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project is developing a user-configurable cryptographically-secure ?privacy shield? to run on smartphones and act upon sensor information flowing to other users, apps, and services. To make privacy understandable, the user is presented with a higher level abstraction for expressing privacy and sharing in terms of rich inferences and contexts drawn from sensor measurements. The user can designate some inferences and contexts as private. To provide privacy while ensuring the quality of service provided by the recipients of the sensory information, the system also incorporates algorithms which, over time, learn a personalized model of the privacy risk from sharing an inference. The theoretical concepts and the system realization are being validated via user studies in mobile health and personal sensing. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: By providing better understanding of the behavioral privacy problem and risks inherent in sharing seemingly innocuous data, results from this project will lead to a more educated and informed citizenry, regulators, and policy makers, and provide effective tools for privacy management to those who share sensory information.

Abstract: This award is for travel support for up to ten students to the 2013 USENIX Workshop on Health Information Technologies (HealthTech13).<br/><br/>Previous USENIX workshops on Health Information Technologies (HIT) have traditionally provided a forum for discussion of aggressively innovative and potentially disruptive ideas on all aspects of medical and health security and privacy, including technology and policy. This year's 2013 USENIX Workshop on Health Information Technologies, called HealthTech13, will be held in conjunction with the annual USENIX Security conference in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 12, 2013. Its focus differs from previous USENIX workshops on HIT by its broader scope that is intended to encourage the development of new technologies that generally improve the quality and safety of healthcare, as well as the access to it. The workshop audience is similarly broadened to encourage greater cross-disciplinary engagement by researchers and practitioners in technology, medicine, and policy communities across academia, government and industry. <br/><br/>The workshop will offer several means by which participants can interact and engage. In addition to keynote and technical research presentations, there will be a poster session and a best research paper award, which will both be a first for this workshop series, and a continuation of last year's successful session for announcing research progress on hard problems.

Abstract: In telerobotic applications, human operators interact with robots through a computer network. This project is developing tools to prevent security threats in telerobotics, by monitoring and detecting malicious activities and correcting for them. To develop tools to prevent and mitigate security threats against telerobotic systems, this project adapts cybersecurity methods and extends them to cyber-physical systems. Knowledge about physical constraints and interactions between the cyber and physical components of the system are leveraged for security. A monitoring system is developed which collects operator commands and robot feedback information to perform real-time verification of the operator. Timely and reliable detection of any discrepancy between real and spoofed operator movements enables quick detection of adversarial activities. The results are evaluated on the UW-developed RAVEN surgical robot.<br/><br/>This project brings together research in robotics, computer and network security, control theory and machine learning, in order to gain better understanding of complex teleoperated robotic systems and to engineer telerobotic systems that provide strict safety, security and privacy guarantees. The results are relevant and applicable to a wide range of applications, including telerobotic surgery, search and rescue missions, military operations, underwater infrastructure and repair, cleanup and repair in hazardous environments, mining, as well as manipulation/inspections of objects in low earth orbit. The project algorithms, software and hardware are being made available to the non-profit cyber-physical research community. Graduate and undergraduate students are being trained in cyber-physical systems security topics, and K-12, community college students and under-represented minority students are being engaged.

Abstract: Modern automobiles are no longer mere mechanical devices; they are pervasively monitored and controlled by dozens of digital computers coordinated via internal vehicular networks and bridged to external networks as well. While this transformation has driven major advancements in efficiency, safety and convenience, it has also introduced a broad range of new potential risks. In this effort, we are evaluating these risks by experimentally mapping the attack surface of the modern automobile, identifying architectural security and privacy vulnerabilities, and developing new defense methodologies that can provide safety within the rubric of the existing automotive design ecosystem.

Abstract: Data provenance refers to the history of the contents of an object and its successive transformations. Knowledge of data provenance is beneficial to many ends, such as enhancing data trustworthiness, facilitating accountability, verifying compliance, aiding forensics, and enabling more effective access and usage controls. Provenance data minimally needs integrity assurance to realize these benefits. Additionally, provenance data may need assurances of confidentiality (e.g., protect the identity of a reviewer in a blinded paper review process from the authors but not from the editor) or of privacy (e.g., do not disclose identity of a source without the source's consent). In the past decade there has been significant progress regarding the structure and representation of provenance data as a directed acyclic graph. However, currently there is no overarching, systematic framework for the security and privacy of provenance data and their tradeoffs with respect to the utility of provenance data. The development of such a framework is recognized as one of a handful of promising thrusts in recent reports on Federal game-changing R&D for cyber security, particularly aligned with the theme of Tailored Trustworthy Spaces.<br/><br/>This project is to develop a comprehensive technical and scientific framework to address the security and privacy challenges of provenance data, and the attendant tradeoffs, so that our society can gain maximum benefit from applications of provenance data. Detailed foundational research is to be performed on security enhanced data models, access control and usage models, privacy including annonymization and sanitization, integrity, accountability and risk management techniques for provenance data. This foundational research is complemented by data provenance case studies in scientific and cyber security information sharing, and construction of prototype data provenance systems at the operating systems and data layers. Moreover, reference architectures and definitions of corresponding provenance management services are to be defined, identifying how these services can be effectively deployed in enterprises, and developing a risk-management framework to guide application architects, designers and users to effectively embed data provenance in their specific context. The project results will beneficially impact society at large by increasing trustworthiness of data acquired, transmitted and processed by computer systems. From the educational side, both theory and practice of data provenance are to be integrated in the undergraduate and graduate training of students, including underrepresented minority and female students, in all the collaborative institutions of this project.

Abstract: Programs with potentially malicious content are becoming increasingly common. Such programs are usually highly obfuscated, using a variety of techniques that make it difficult to analyze the code, figure out its internal logic, and develop countermeasures. Existing tools for reverse engineering such programs are primitive and require a great deal of tedious and time-consuming manual intervention, which hampers the timely development of defenses against newly discovered malware. This project aims to devise automatic techniques to simplify away these obfuscations and thereby make it significantly faster and easier to understand the internal logic of obfuscated code with potentially malicious content. <br/><br/>The project uses dynamic program analysis techniques to identify instructions that affect the program's observable behavior; these instructions are then extracted and, where appropriate, simplified using equational techniques. Key research questions investigated include simplification in the face of arbitrary obfuscations and combinations of obfuscations, including (possibly multiple layers of) self-modification and emulation. The main impact of this project will be to make it easier and quicker for security researchers to figure out the internal logic of malware programs. This, in turn, will make it possible to respond more quickly to new malware and develop countermeasures to them faster and with less manual intervention. The effect will be to reduce the damage done by malware before they can be neutralized.

Abstract: This research considers a scenario in which a piece of software needs to be protected against an attacker (the man-at-the-end, MATE) who has physical access to the software and so is able to inspect, modify, and execute it. The goal is to prevent the attacker from extracting sensitive information from the software, to prevent him from making changes to the behavior of the software, or, at least, to detect and report when such attacks are underway.<br/><br/>Man-at-the-end attacks can have serious consequences. For example, on an individual scale they can violate the privacy and integrity of medical records and other sensitive personal data; on a larger scale, such attacks can cripple national infrastructure (such as the power grid and the Internet itself).<br/><br/>This project explores innovative approaches to protect distributed systems from MATE attacks. To accomplish comprehensive defenses, the project develops MATE attack models and security metrics that formally characterize the process of device compromise, provides attack tools to allow easy testing of defense algorithms, and devises community standards for defense evaluation. Rigorously defined security metrics are necessary for research outcomes to be compared to existing and future approaches. A primary goal of this research is therefore to develop evaluation procedures for MATE defense mechanisms. This includes both universal obfuscation metrics and detailed red-team exercise protocols.

Abstract: The digital provenance of a digital object gives a history of its life cycle including its creation, update, and access. It thus provides meta-level information about the sequence of events that lead up to the current version of the object, as well as its chain of custody. Such provenance information can be used for a variety of purposes, such as identifying the origins of a document, assessing the quality or reliability of data, and detecting undesirable actions such as forgery or unauthorized alteration of data. However, all of these practical uses of provenance information presuppose that the provenance system is secure, i.e. that provenance data is collected, processed, and stored in a manner that ensures its confidentiality and integrity. Without such guarantees, users can get an incorrect impression of document authenticity, potentially with significant real-world consequences.<br/><br/>This project investigates the design of secure provenance collection systems where the collected meta-data can be relied upon even in light of realistic insider attack models. Security, however, is not sufficient; a practical system must also be efficient even when large amounts of fine-grained provenance data needs to be stored and processed. The project is aimed at addressing both issues through the following three objectives. (1) Techniques for continuously updatable software tamperproofing to ensure the integrity of the system itself. (2) Techniques for robust, continuous marking, collusion-free, text fingerprinting to mitigate document leakage. (3) Techniques for anonymous storage on untrusted storage servers to allow for efficient storage and access of fine-grained provenance data.

Abstract: Cybersecurity is paramount to protecting national interests in domains that include but extend well beyond defense and finance. However, current state-of-the-art cyber-defenses have severely limited predictive and attribution capabilities. Detecting and understanding cyber attacks is not sufficient--we can liken that to "studying symptoms instead of a disease."<br/><br/>This research carries out a synergistic approach to integrating cyber data forensics with human-centric social network analysis under a common framework. The three major activities of this project are as follows: (a) comprehensive models of cyber-attack characteristics are developed using feature extraction techniques on diverse data sources, (b) adversarial groups are classified according to their feature similarities, and (c) group classification is enhanced using analytic techniques from social network science.<br/><br/>To accomplish these activities: (1) different models for constructing joint representations of computer and social networks are investigated within a multi-mode graph framework; (2) data reduction and feature extraction techniques are developed for associating large datasets with this unified graph model; (3) an existing system is leveraged to discover invisible and missing links between adversarial networks of individuals; and (4) social network models and tools, as well as case studies, are applied to infer adversarial group typology.<br/><br/>This research is expected to benefit computer science, cyber security, and social sciences by improving detection methods for cyber attacks. Applying time-series analysis in creative ways to multi-mode networks should contribute to the field of artificial intelligence. This joint work should apply also in fields such as health care, marketing, or forecasting technology adoption trends.

Abstract: One of the main impediment to a wider adoption of cloud storage and computing services is the need to keep data private. Recently, several research communities have begun exploring new techniques that allow a client to outsource storage and computation over private data to a potentially untrusted cloud service, while maintaining the privacy of the data. These techniques are highly varied depending on a large number of factors, like the ownership of the input and output data, the type of processing required, the desired level of protection, and the level of trust that the client is willing to put in different components of the outsourcing service. This highly collaborative project combines many different areas of expertise with the aim of substantially changing the way outsourced data and computation are perceived and used in the real world.<br/><br/>This project focuses on finding a modular approach to the specification, design and analysis of privacy preserving mechanisms in the context of outsourced computation. The investigators explore a broad solution space that combines algorithmic techniques, limited use of trusted hardware, and distributed computation and trust, and create a common framework that allows one to compare and analyze vastly different solutions in a modular and composable manner. The project will also explore the theoretical and practical limits of what each of these solutions can achieve and hone in on a practical solution that possibly combines many different techniques to achieve the right balance of efficiency and security.

Abstract: Side-channel attack (SCA) has shown to be a serious implementation attack to many cryptosystems. Practical countermeasures only mitigate the vulnerability to some extent. Considerable research efforts on leakage-resilient cryptography have so far not led to practical leakage-resilient implementations. One hindering reason is the lack of commonly accepted and sound metrics, standards, and evaluation procedures to measure and evaluate the vulnerability/resilience of cryptosystems to various side-channel attacks. Accurate modeling of side channels, however, is one of the open problems in applied crypto research. This project aims to close the gap between SCA theories and practices by formalizing a general framework for side-channel attack analysis and security evaluation of cryptosystems. <br/><br/>The proposed framework quantifies the effect of algorithmic and implementation characteristics on the success rate of the theoretically strongest maximum likelihood attack, revealing system-inherent SCA-related parameters for security improvement. The framework will extract maximum leakage from the observed measurement data in the black-box scenario, often the realistic situation for adversaries. State-of-the-art statistical methods are employed in the framework to precisely analyze and evaluate the overall side-channel leakage. This holistic framework will significantly alleviate the burden of security system architects, software developers, and hardware designers in their quest to build SCA security into systems they design, so as to ultimately yield provably secure hardware.

Abstract: Most cryptographic applications crucially rely on secret keys that are chosen randomly and are unknown to an attacker. Unfortunately, the process of deriving secret keys in practice is often difficult, error-prone and riddled with security vulnerabilities. Badly generated keys offer a prevalent source of attacks that render complex cryptographic applications completely insecure, despite their sophisticated design and rigorous mathematical analysis. Even though key derivation plays a central role in the security landscape, it has received surprisingly little formal study within the cryptographic community, leading to a large disconnect between the theory and practice.<br/><br/>In this project, several important scenarios for key derivation are examined for their capability to improve security with provable guarantees, including the use of random number generators (RNGs), passwords, and biometrics. In particular:<br/><br/>- How RNGs are designed to properly combine the entropy gathering, randomness extraction and pseudorandom generation modules, while achieving the best possible subset of clearly defined security properties against a variety of adversarial scenarios.<br/><br/>- How to reduce the effectiveness of ?offline dictionary attacks? when generating keys from passwords.<br/><br/>- How biometrics can be safely reused to generate many secret keys across many applications raises several interesting questions, combining cryptographic security properties with those of error-correcting codes.

Abstract: Cryptographers have invented many different types of encryption. The PIs' research brings many of these under one umbrella, thereby reconceptualizing the landscape of modern cryptography. In the process, the research puts forward some entirely new kinds of encryption. The work is motivated by the needs of existing security practice. Sample questions include how to save space when storing encrypted copies of the same material in the cloud, and how to encrypt a credit-card number by reimagining the process as the shuffling of a deck of cards. The research demonstrates the practical benefits to cryptography and security from inclusive reinterpretations what encryption does.<br/><br/>In more detail, leaky encryption formalizes what it means to divulge some particular function of the message, unifying notions like blockciphers, online ciphers, and order-preserving encryption. Shuffle-based encryption creates blockciphers in a way fundamentally different from the way Feistel and SP networks do. Message-locked encryption can encrypt with a key derived from the message itself, to enable secure de-duplication. Password-based encryption incorporates a "salt" to provide what the PIs call multi-instance security. Circuit encryption can encrypt a circuit and its input to ciphertexts that permit the evaluation of the one on the other, but in a way that reveals only correctly computed result. These are just some of the aims the research encompasses.

Abstract: For nearly 40 years, the United States has faced a critical problem: increasing demand for energy has outstripped the ability of the systems and markets that supply power. Today, a variety of promising new technologies offer a solution to this problem. Clean, renewable power generation, such as solar and wind are increasingly available. Hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles offer greater energy efficiency in transportation. The power grid that manages the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power, however, was designed and constructed in the 1960's and is ill-suited to handle these emerging energy technologies. Operating the electrical grid using power sources with random and uncertain availability, like solar and wind, requires new sensing and control methods. Widespread use of plug-in/hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) will not only require far greater power capacity, but will also radically change the peak usage profile, with large evening demand that cannot be shifted. To address this problem, our current power grid must be upgraded with a control system that uses the full power of modern sensor and computing technology to increase efficiency. This new power grid, with an integrated, modern IT control plane is commonly referred to as the Smart Grid, which uses distributed control, customer integration and market based control mechanisms. <br/><br/>It is critical to build security features into this Smart Grid from the beginning to ensure fairness, to provide warnings of misuse, to provide control algorithms that minimize damage from malicious behavior, and most importantly, to provide robustness and high-availability of power delivery even in the presence of bad-faith actors. This project develops methods to achieve security in power and market delivery. This entails a study of economic market models with stability as one objective but also in consideration of new sources of power and usage, both on the producer and the consumer sides. To achieve security, the following techniques are used synergistically: vulnerability discovery by formal analysis; on-line monitoring, anomaly and specification-based intrusion detection; and recovery and reconstitution by feedback control. Unique to this project, it is emphasized that the security enhancements take place at both the market level and the system level, requiring separate state-estimation models. These seemingly disparate domains are unified through mapping functions among the states of the respective models. By integrating the two control models, future Smart Grids can detect and respond to activity, either malicious or caused by natural disturbances, that threaten either level; the unification of the models permits the investigation of attacks that possibly impact both levels. Results of this work would lead to a secure and reliable Smart Grid architecture that is robust in the face of attacks on both the power delivery and market control systems. The inherent cross-disciplinary nature of the research will educate future researchers to be conversant in both cyber-security and associated economic issues, through co-advising between the departments of Computer Science and Economics at both UC Davis and Pennsylvania State University and through course modules developed under this work, again involving both campuses. Results will be transitioned to partnership with PG&E, SMUD, the West Davis Village, and other utilities in California, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut.

Specifically, project objectives are a) Apply and validate existing theories in the realm of general criminology (in particular Akers? social learning theory and Gottfredson and Hirschi?s general theory of crime) to study cyber crimes; b) Derive novel Internet usage features as fingerprints for cyber crimes; c) Design classification algorithms (based on multi-fractal analysis and petri-net designs) to subsequently model multiple dynamics of cyber criminals by integrating theoretical and practical outcomes from the above two objectives; and d) Extensively test and validate project outcomes. The core novelty of this project is in using real Internet data from subjects (initially a cyber savvy college sample) that is collected continuously, unobtrusively, while still preserving a high degree of privacy.<br/><br/><br/>Outcomes of this project will have far reaching impacts. It lays a foundation for fusing expertise in social sciences (specifically criminology) and cyber security, as a result of which existing theories in general criminology can be empirically tested for practical validity in studying cyber crimes. The identification of unique Internet fingerprints associating with cyber crimes will provide new insights into human centered aspects of cyber crimes, which is lacking today. The classification algorithms designed will provide cyber defenders with new tools to combat cyber crimes from multiple perspectives including prevention, detection, forensic investigations and prosecution.

Abstract: The security of critical information infrastructures depends upon effective techniques to detect vulnerabilities commonly exploited by malicious attacks. Due to poor coding practices or human error, a known vulnerability discovered and patched in one code location may often exist in many other unpatched code locations, either in the same code base or other code bases. Furthermore, patches are often error-prone, resulting in new vulnerabilities. This project develops practical techniques for detecting code-level similarity to prevent such vulnerabilities. It has the potential to help build a more reliable and secure information system infrastructure, which will have tremendous economical impact on society because of our growing reliance on information technologies.<br/><br/>In particular, the project aims to develop practical techniques for similarity-based testing and analysis to detect unpatched vulnerable code and validate patches to the detected vulnerable code at both the source code and binary levels. To this end, it focuses on three main technical directions: (1) developing techniques for detecting source-level vulnerabilities by adapting and refining an industrial-strength tool, (2) developing capabilities of detecting binary-level vulnerabilities by extending preliminary work on detecting code clones in binaries, and (3) supporting patch validation and repair by developing methodologies and techniques to validate software patches and help produce correct, secure patches. This project helps discover new techniques for source- and binary-level vulnerability analysis and gain better understandings of the fundamental and practical challenges for building highly secure and reliable software.

Abstract: OpenSSH reveals excerpts from encrypted login sessions. TLS (HTTPS) reveals encrypted PayPal account cookies. DTLS is no better. EAXprime allows instantaneous forgeries. RFID security has been broken again and again. All of these failures of confidentiality and integrity are failures of authenticated ciphers: algorithms that promise to encrypt and authenticate messages using a shared secret key.<br/><br/>It is easy to blame many of these security problems on a lack of education: much stronger authenticated ciphers have been in the literature for many years. However, in many cases these stronger authenticated ciphers fail to meet the performance requirements of the applications. Performance is exactly the motivation for RC4 in WEP; EAXprime in the "Smart Grid"; HB in RFID; and "IPsec" continuing to support unauthenticated encryption.<br/><br/>This project is building a new generation of authenticated ciphers that improve efficiency without compromising security and that improve security without compromising efficiency. This work spans seven main topics: more efficient ciphers; more efficient MACs; more efficient forgery rejection; improved protection against side channels; improved protection against misuse and bad luck; improved quantitative security; and improved security proofs. The ultimate objective is to obtain the best possible security subject to a variety of performance constraints specified by cryptographic users.<br/><br/>The high-security high-performance authenticated ciphers produced in this project will be directly and straightforwardly usable in cryptographic applications, avoiding the disasters in current applications and finally bringing secure secret-key cryptography from theory to practice.

Abstract: Web applications are prevalent and enable much of today's online<br/>business including banking, shopping, university admissions, and various<br/>governmental activities. However, the quality of such applications is<br/>usually low, and they are increasingly popular targets for attack. This<br/>project aims at developing practical testing and analysis mechanisms and<br/>tools to secure web applications. In particular, it focuses on<br/>developing novel, principled techniques to address the following<br/>research issues: (1) how to formalize security threats in web<br/>applications; (2) how to provide runtime security for deployed<br/>applications via dynamic monitoring; and (3) how to provide static<br/>security enforcement during application development and testing.<br/><br/>The project is interdisciplinary, touching upon a number of requisite<br/>areas including computer security, software engineering, and programming<br/>languages. It has the potential to advance knowledge in each of these<br/>disciplines with novel formulations of security requirements, systems<br/>concepts, and advanced testing and analysis techniques. The project<br/>also has the potential for significant industrial and societal impact.<br/>Through the proposed research, education, and outreach activities, the<br/>project will empower web application developers with the knowledge,<br/>methodologies, and development tools to build secure web<br/>applications. Testing and analysis tools developed in the project will<br/>also be distributed to other institutions and the industry for teaching,<br/>research, and experimental evaluation.

Abstract: This project explores process composition tools as applied to elections, concentrating particularly on mail-in and Internet voting. This includes exploration of how to compose systems from pre-analyzed process components, how to analyze the vulnerability of these systems to attacks, and how to guarantee that important security properties are ensured for the resulting composed system. The underlying processes represent aspects of national and local elections, their composition produces an election process, and analysis of the composition gives insight into potential errors or attacks on the election.<br/><br/>Elections are human-intensive processes, processes that directly involve humans in important decision-making and coordination activities, including their interactions with hardware and software components. Providing an approach for formally reasoning about human participation extends current security work. The project also breaks new ground by exploring process-based approaches for modeling and defending against attacks.<br/><br/>The project works closely with government agencies at both the national and local levels to provide in-depth realistic evaluation of results.<br/><br/>Election officials in the U.S. can directly employ the results of this work to make U.S. election processes more verifiably secure, simpler, and easier to change as new technologies, laws, and regulations are imposed. Moreover the technologies developed in this project can be used in most human-intensive processes that have critical security concerns.

Abstract: Hypervisors are the building blocks of cloud computing. They host the virtualized operating systems and applications which provide highly-scalable, pervasive services on a continuous basis. These thin-layer, bare-metal operating systems create a prime target for attack. A compromised hypervisor grants access to hosted virtual machines and data stores. Its computing resources can be used for malicious purposes, including mounting additional attacks. To avoid detection, rooted hypervisors must not only avoid tripping internal alarms, but also convince external monitors that they are operating normally. To conceal illicit activities, they may underreport performance metrics. Although rootkits can hide unauthorized activity by understating system load, they cannot tamper with external measures of power usage. This research develops a new method for identifying compromised hypervisors which integrates energy usage statistics. This method correlates independent measures of server energy usage with hypervisor reports of system state to create models of power consumption. The detection process focuses on hypervisors which appear to use more power than expected, given reported performance metrics. Three out-of-band tests for detecting compromise are undergoing testing and refinement. The results of this research will indicate the effectiveness of energy correlation-approaches at identifying rooted hypervisors. If successful, this project will provide a platform-neutral method for cloud management monitors to identify compromised hypervisors. It reduces adoption risks for organizations and individual users of cloud services. In addition, it will provide opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to developed advanced skills in cloud and data center security.

Abstract: Many compelling applications involve computations that require sensitive data from two or more individuals. For example, as the cost of personal genome sequencing rapidly plummets many genetics applications will soon be within reach of individuals such as comparing one?s genome with the genomes of different groups of participants in a study to determine which treatment is likely to be most effective. Such comparisons could have tremendous value, but are currently infeasible because of the privacy concerns both for the individual and study participants. What is needed is a way to produce the result of the comparison without exposing either party's private inputs. The ultimate aim of this project is to make privacy-preserving computation practical and accessible enough to be used routinely in applications such as personalized genetics, medical research, and privacy-preserving biometrics.<br/><br/>Theoretical solutions to this problem, known as secure multi-party computation, have been known for several decades, including a general solution developed by Andrew Yao based on garbled circuits. Because of its extensive memory use and computational cost, however, the garbled circuits approach has traditionally been considered more of a theoretical curiosity than a practical mechanism for building privacy-preserving applications. Recent developments in cryptographic techniques and new implementation approaches are beginning to change this, however, and admit the possibility of scalable, practical secure computation. This project is designing methods for avoiding the memory bottleneck associated with garbled circuit evaluation by aggressively pipelining circuit generation and evaluation, and exploring a variety of techniques for reducing the size of garbled circuits. Another issue the limits the use of secure computation in practice is the need for standard protocols to assume an honest-but-curious adversary who always follows the specified protocol. This project is developing new techniques for dealing with malicious adversaries, improving the standard cut-and-choose and commit-and-prove approaches by using new cryptographic tools and exploring an alternate model in which a verifiable trusted party generates the circuit but is not trusted with any private data. The project is also developing techniques to audit the information that can be inferred from the result of a secure computation. Another goal is to make secure computation more accessible to developers by developing programming tools for defining secure computations at a high level, based on information-flow analysis and program partitioning.

Abstract: Software development is a complex and manual process, in part because typical software programs contain more than hundreds of thousands lines of computer code. If software programmers fail to perform critical checks in that code, such as making sure a user is authorized to update an account, serious security compromises ensue. Indeed, vulnerable software is one of the leading causes of cyber security problems. Checking for security problems is very expensive because it requires examining computer code for security mistakes, and such a process requires significant manual effort. This research project aims at developing an interactive help system to warn software programmers about potential security mistakes, similar to the way modern word processors warn writers of spelling and grammar errors. This is likely lead to new functions for software development tools that will significantly reduce security vulnerabilities in software.<br/><br/>The research is based on the concept of interactive static analysis, a novel mixed-initiative paradigm for interacting with programmers to aid in the detection and prevention of security vulnerabilities. Static analysis is seamlessly integrated into the development environment in such a way that programmers are not required to learn additional programming language and analysis concepts beyond the use of the development environment. Static analysis is performed in the context of development, allowing programmers to utilize and influence such analysis during their program construction. The goals of this research are to bring programmers into the security loop, improving their ability to detect, understand, and prevent vulnerabilities; and utilize the programmer's contextual knowledge to drive customized static analysis, detecting software vulnerabilities that are difficult to detect using current static analysis techniques.

Abstract: The ubiquity of computing technology and the Internet have created an age of big data that has the potential to greatly enhance the efficiency of our societies and the well-being of all people. The trend comes with problems that threaten to prevent or undermine the benefits. An immediate concern is how to fuse, integrate and analyze data while respecting privacy, security and usage concerns. A second issue is allowing data to remain distributed, enabling its owners to maintain and control quality as well as to enforce security and privacy policies. A final underlying challenge is helping to produce sound and useful results by assuring that systems understand the meaning of the data being integrated and analyzing access and usage policies. For some domains, like health informatics and clinical research, solving these problems will have a significant impact on society.<br/><br/>This project explores an approach to solving these problems by developing a policy-compliant integration system for linked healthcare data. The system models data, schemas and policies using open Web standards such as Semantic Web languages, federates queries to independent Linked Data stores based on content, provides policy enforcement by modifying incompliant queries, and uses formal methods to guarantee correctness of key components.<br/><br/>This project provides new approaches to solving one of the most significant problems our society faces in the 21st century: benefiting from the integration of distributed linked data while respecting security, privacy, and usage requirements. The prototype tools and systems are incorporated into our educational activities and made available to others via appropriate open source licenses.

Abstract: Silicon physically unclonable function (PUF) is a supplemental circuit embedded in an IC which generates signatures unique to its native IC. This signature could be used for authentication, protection of data and secure communication. PUFs rely on the presence of uncontrollable variations in the fabrication process causing the circuit parameters to exhibit randomness. Current approaches for PUF design have mostly investigated circuit and architectural aspects. PUF quality is severely marred by a lack of understanding of exactly how fabrication process variations impact the PUF responses. Much of the existing work assumes the fabrication process to be a black box. This results in several opportunities being unutilized. This research investigates fundamentally different approaches to PUF enhancements. It leverages quantified models for fabrication randomness that have been developed in Design for Manufacturability related research endeavors. This research looks into mask, circuit and layout level techniques along with their interdependence.<br/><br/>This work enables improved silicon PUFs thereby increasing the possibility of their adoption. Our approaches would be useful for both semiconductor manufacturing companies and fab-less design houses. On an education front, PhD students shall be involved in the core aspect of this work while undergraduates shall be used for data collection, analysis and test-bed development. Lastly, this project plans to enhance infrastructure for research and education by making available all the artifacts produced by this research in public domain. Further outreach efforts such as tutorials, panel discussions, etc. shall also be organized.

Abstract: This proposal provides support for the 2013 Workshop on the Economics of Information Security (WEIS) and a one-day follow-on workshop. WEIS fosters cross-disciplinary, cross-sector (i.e., academia, industry, nonprofit, and government), and cross-national discussion on information security. The focus on the economics of information security was chosen not only because of its intrinsic importance, but also because of its basis for bringing together social, computer, and information scientists and engineers to share knowledge, information and methods from their respective domains. WEIS covers issues that are core to the NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, and spans both the Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) Directorates within the Foundation. The one-day follow-on workshop focuses on incentive-related issues to cybersecurity.<br/><br/>Funds for this grant are from NSF for student travel support, and via inter-agency transfer from DHS Science & Technology for sponsorship of the follow-on workshop.

Abstract: Considerable research in the field has been focused on developing new technologies to enhance privacy; encryption of personal data is often presented as a potential solution. Many of the technologies resulting from this research are not being effectively utilized because of issues rooted in human judgment under risk and uncertainty. The majority of existing models and products related to human judgement are based on a limited number of documented incidents and on questionable assumptions about user intent and behavior. To better develop and apply privacy technologies requires better methods of understanding and measuring human perceptions of privacy.<br/><br/>In this project we are investigating the underlying neurobiological manifestations of privacy, and seeing to understand -- and measure -- variations of uncertainty in online privacy decisions. The outcomes of this proposed project will contribute to answering fundamental questions about human behavior in online environments?e.g., under what circumstances do systems in the mind cooperate or compete in privacy decisions? When there is competition, how and where is it adjudicated? Do higher-level deliberative processes rely similarly on multiple mechanisms, or a single, unitary set of mechanisms? We anticipate these results being used to further refine and develop useful privacy policies and technologies.

Abstract: Attributed-based obligatory access control is a new access control paradigm for achieving fine-grained authorization and assured system accountability. However, access control and obligation policies can be implemented incorrectly for various reasons, such as programming errors and misunderstanding about the policies. It is important to reveal discrepancy between the policy specification and the actual system implementation. The objective of this ?Transition To Practice? project is to develop an open source tool for model-based testing of attribute-based access control and obligation policies. It can build test models by integrating attribute-based access control and obligation rules with functional test models, generate test cases from the test models to meet given coverage criteria, and transform model-level test cases into executable code in a target language and test execution environment. The test code can then be executed with the system under test to exercise the access control and obligation policies. The tool is applicable to a great variety of systems due to the support for various programming languages and test execution environments. It is independent of how access control and obligation policies are implemented in the system under test. The broader impacts of this project include deployment of the tool to various academic and industry projects and involvement of students, particularly undergraduate students, in cutting-edge research.

Abstract: Mobile (wireless) communication has become an essential information exchange platform for today's enterprise and government organizations. They need to secure mobile devices as they secure wired devices. Today, it is common for these organizations to have multiple external mobile and wireless connections to the outside world to provide high bandwidth and tolerate connection failures. One way to protect the network perimeter is to use border gateways that impose a uniform static policy on network traffic (wired and wireless) entering through its borders and by installing effective security schemes and policies on mobile devices itself. While being simple, such a static policy has many disadvantages and may not provide necessary protection to mobile and wired perimeter. They are (a) unable to react to changes in its external environment, (b) they have physical limitations and differences in trust relationships, and (c) completeness among a non- communicating set of policies is problematic. Therefore, in order to provide perimeter protection policies that react to dynamic changes (quite frequent in mobile perimeter) and respect organizational objectives such as preferential treatment, yet enforce overall security objectives of organizations, requires that individual policies enforced at each border gateway be (a) dynamic and flexible, and (b) be a part of a global policy such that taken together enforce common security objectives in mobile infrastructure. In this proposal we achieve this by a logic-based security framework. Our solution has the potential to improve the security while reducing the management costs.

Abstract: The objective of this research is to prove that cyber-physical systems are safe before they are deployed. The approaches the research investigates are extensions of approaches used to test communications protocols. The problems with cyber-physical systems are that 1) they are much more complicated than communications protocols, 2) time is a more critical component of these systems, and 3) in a competitive environment there are likely to be many implementations that must interoperate.<br/><br/>The complexity of communications protocols is reduced by using a layered architecture. Each layer provides a well defined service to the next layer. This research is developing multi-dimensional architectures that reflect the different ways that the cyber-physical system interacts with the physical world. The techniques are evaluated on a driver-assisted merge protocol. An architecture for the merge protocol has four dimensions organized as stacks for communications, external sensors, vehicle monitoring and control, and timing. This architecture will also be useful during standardization.<br/><br/>Timing increases verification complexity by increasing the number of potential execution paths. The research conducted in this project explores how to reduce the number of paths by synchronizing clocks and using simultaneous operations. This approach is reasonable because of the timing accuracy now available with GPS. A two step verification process is used that creates an unambiguous model of the cyber-physical system, first proving that the model is safe, then checking that each implementation conforms to the model. This reduces the number and cost of tests for a three-party merge protocol. Specifically, assuming there are N implementation versions for different manufacturers and models, this approach reduces the number of necessary interaction tests, which would be cubic in N, to a single model verification and N conformance tests.

Abstract: Moving Target defense (MTD) is a new Cybersecurity paradigm for deterring and disturbing attacks proactively in order to counter the ?asymmetry? phenomena in cyber warfare. A number of moving target techniques have been recently proposed to inverse this asymmetry by randomizing systems? attributes (e.g., configuration) and exhibiting non-determinism to attackers. However, due to potential inter-dependency between various MTD mechanisms, an ad hoc combination of MTD techniques can cause profoundly detrimental effect on security, performance and the operational integrity of the system.<br/><br/>This project is investigating novel and transformative approaches to formulate a prescriptive framework to instantiate new MTD strategies that are correct-by-construction, from an arbitrary list of MTD mechanisms. The proposed framework enables integrating MTD mechanisms vertically, or horizontally, while balancing the benefit and cost of the synthesized integrated MTD strategy. As a case study, two main classes of MTD mechanisms, namely, Host Configuration Mutation and Network Configuration Mutation, are integrated to create a cohesive and more powerful composite MTD mechanism.<br/><br/>To this end, the results of this research enable new theoretical foundations and transformative approaches in the science of moving target defense by contributing to the understanding of automated reasoning for moving target defense synthesis and evaluation. As this far-forward looking EAGER proposal exhibits high-risk, it also entails high-value that is to be always many steps ahead of attackers. Through the development of a framework for reasoning about MTD, MTD course modules will be developed. The software artifacts permit for further experimentation and progress in this area.

Abstract: This project is funded as part of the United States-Israel Collaboration in Computer Science (USICCS) program. Through this program, NSF and the United States - Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) jointly support collaborations among US-based researchers and Israel-based researchers. The availability of fast and cheap computers coupled with massive storage devices has enabled the collection and mining of data on a scale previously unimaginable. This opens the door to potential abuse regarding individuals' information. This work explores the fundamental tradeoffs between privacy for individuals' data and the usefulness of the information one can obtain from these large datasets.<br/><br/>Differential privacy is a well-established paradigm aimed at mitigating the drawbacks of traditional anonymization techniques, as it provides a rigorous guarantee for the added risk to an individual in participating in a database. This research addresses fundamental questions clarifying the boundaries of what is possible under differential privacy and its relaxations, by exploring the fundamental conflicts between privacy and utility and the additional tensions introduced by computational efficiency. This work expands the potential impact of differentially private algorithms on real-world applications, and also ensures broad impact via curriculum development, pedagogical development, and outreach activities.

Abstract: Wireless connectivity has become the primary way most users access cyberspace. The wide use of the internet on wireless and mobile devices is further encouraged with new services that simultaneously engage and connect a large number of users. As a result, the society at large is quickly getting comfortable with the idea of conducting everyday lives on mobile devices most of which require communicating sensitive and confidential information over the wireless medium. Consequently, secure access to cyberspace necessitates wireless security. Wireless, being an open medium, is more prone to malicious cyber acts as compared to wired connectivity. On the other hand, this medium also presents unique opportunities to provide security guarantees through the interaction of nodes and advanced physical layer techniques. In particular, information theoretic security emerges with design insights that provide guaranteed security against computationally unlimited adversaries. In order to do so, information theory assumes a network of altruistic nodes and looks for fundamental performance limits which usually come with complex interaction and coordination requirements. The premise of this project is that this idealistic set-up can be successfully transformed into a practical one by amalgamating information theory with the theory of incentives in order to provide secure wireless cyber access.<br/><br/>Specific research topics being addressed include the development of: (1) mechanisms to incentivize non-altruistic cognitive nodes to participate in information theoretic security protocols; (2) incentive mechanisms for scenarios where all nodes have equal access to spectrum and need confidentiality, even from each other; (3) techniques for providing security to groups of cooperative nodes and the associated trust issues; (4) incentive mechanisms for combating active attacks; (5) strategies for combating colluding adversaries; and (6) mechanisms to ensure that nodes have the incentive to adopt a given security protocol.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this work include: (1) providing secure access to cyberspace via the wireless medium; (2) new design insights for practical security protocols; and (3) amalgamating information theory and game theory via incentive mechanisms. Educational broader impacts include: (1) dissemination of research results in the form of tutorials and short courses; (2) enhancing graduate-student research experiences via a three-university research exchange program; (3) incorporating the research results into graduate and undergraduate communications courses; and (4) recruitment of and mentorship for women in engineering and science.

Abstract: The electric power grid is a national critical infrastructure that is increasing vulnerable to malicious physical and cyber attacks. As a result, detailed data describing grid topology and components is considered highly sensitive information that can be shared only under strict non-disclosure agreements. There is also increasing need to foster cooperation among the growing number of participants in microgrid-enabled electric marketplace. However, to maintain their economic competitiveness, the market participants are not inclined to share sensitive information about their grid with other participants. Motivated by this need for increased cyber-physical security and economic confidentiality, the project is developing techniques to obfuscate sensitive design information in power system models without jeopardizing the quality of the solutions obtained from such models. Specifically, solution approaches have been developed to hide sensitive structural information in Direct Current (DC) Optimal Power Flow models. These approaches are currently being extended to Alternating Current (AC) Optimal Power Flow models. The project is also developing secure multi-party methods where the market participants collectively optimize the grid operation while only sharing encrypted private sensitive information. Finally, the project is incorporating secure market operations in jointly solving the Optimal Power Dispatch problem without revealing sensitive private information from each participant to other participants. The techniques developed in this project have the potential to broadly impact areas beyond power systems. The general principles developed in the project can be used to mask sensitive information in many problems that can be formulated as a linear or non-linear programming optimization.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) encompass a large variety of systems including for example future energy systems (e.g. smart grid), homeland security and emergency response, smart medical technologies, smart cars and air transportation. One of the most important challenges in the design and deployment of Cyber-Physical Systems is how to formally guarantee that they are amenable to effective human control. This is a challenging problem not only because of the operational changes and increasing complexity of future CPS but also because of the nonlinear nature of the human-CPS system under realistic assumptions. Current state of the art has in general produced simplified models and has not fully considered realistic assumptions about system and environmental constraints or human cognitive abilities and limitations. To overcome current state of the art limitations, our overall research goal is to develop a theoretical framework for complex human-CPS that enables formal analysis and verification to ensure stability of the overall system operation as well as avoidance of unsafe operating states. To analyze a human-CPS involving a human operator(s) with bounded rationality three key questions are identified: (a) Are the inputs available to the operator sufficient to generate desirable behaviors for the CPS? (b) If so, how easy is it for the operator with her cognitive limitations to drive the system towards a desired behavior? (c) How can areas of poor system performance and determine appropriate mitigations be formally identified? The overall technical approach will be to (a) develop and appropriately leverage general cognitive models that incorporate human limitations and capabilities, (b) develop methods to abstract cognitive models to yield tractable analytical human models (c) develop innovative techniques to design the abstract interface between the human and underlying system to reflect mutual constraints, and (d) extend current state-of-the-art reachability and verification algorithms for analysis of abstract interfaces, iin which one of the systems in the feedback loop (i.e., the user) is mostly unknown, uncertain, highly variable or poorly modeled.<br/><br/>The research will provide contributions with broad significance in the following areas: (1) fundamental principles and algorithms that would serve as a foundation for provably safe robust hybrid control systems for mixed human-CPS (2) methods for the development of analytical human models that incorporate cognitive abilities and limitations and their consequences in human control of CPS, (3) validated techniques for interface design that enables effective human situation awareness through an interface that ensures minimum information necessary for the human to safely control the CPS, (4) new reachability analysis techniques that are scalable and allow rapid determination of different levels of system safety. The research will help to identify problems (such as automation surprises, inadequate or excessive information contained in the user interface) in safety critical, high-risk, or expensive CPS before they are built, tested and deployed. The research will provide the formal foundations for understanding and developing human-CPS and will have a broad range of applications in the domains of healthcare, energy, air traffic control, transportation systems, homeland security and large-scale emergency response. The research will contribute to the advancement of under-represented students in STEM fields through educational innovation and outreach. The code, benchmarks and data will be released via the project website.<br/><br/>Formal descriptions of models of human cognition are in general incompatible with formal models of the Cyber Physical System (CPS) the human operator(s) control. Therefore, it is difficult to determine in a rigorous way whether a CPS controlled by a human operator will be safe or stable and under which circumstances. The objective of this research is to develop an analytic framework of human-CPS systems that encompasses engineering compatible formal models of the human operator that preserve the basic architectural features of human cognition. In this project the team will develop methodologies for building such models as well as techniques for formal verification of the human-CPS system so that performance guarantees can be provided. They will validate models in a variety of domains ranging from air traffic control to large scale emergency response to the administration of anesthesia.

Abstract: OpenSSH reveals excerpts from encrypted login sessions. TLS (HTTPS) reveals encrypted PayPal account cookies. DTLS is no better. EAXprime allows instantaneous forgeries. RFID security has been broken again and again. All of these failures of confidentiality and integrity are failures of authenticated ciphers: algorithms that promise to encrypt and authenticate messages using a shared secret key.<br/><br/>It is easy to blame many of these security problems on a lack of education: much stronger authenticated ciphers have been in the literature for many years. However, in many cases these stronger authenticated ciphers fail to meet the performance requirements of the applications. Performance is exactly the motivation for RC4 in WEP; EAXprime in the "Smart Grid"; HB in RFID; and "IPsec" continuing to support unauthenticated encryption.<br/><br/>This project is building a new generation of authenticated ciphers that improve efficiency without compromising security and that improve security without compromising efficiency. This work spans seven main topics: more efficient ciphers; more efficient MACs; more efficient forgery rejection; improved protection against side channels; improved protection against misuse and bad luck; improved quantitative security; and improved security proofs. The ultimate objective is to obtain the best possible security subject to a variety of performance constraints specified by cryptographic users.<br/><br/>The high-security high-performance authenticated ciphers produced in this project will be directly and straightforwardly usable in cryptographic applications, avoiding the disasters in current applications and finally bringing secure secret-key cryptography from theory to practice.

Abstract: Increasingly, different organizations need to securely share their private data to execute many critical tasks. Recently, several different approaches based on secure multi-party computation (SMC) and data sanitization techniques have emerged to enable privacy preserving distributed data analytics. Although SMC based privacy-preserving protocols allow the participating parties to learn only the final (accurate) result, they do not scale well for large amounts of data. On the other hand, sanitization based techniques allow organizations to reveal privacy sensitive data under some privacy guarantees by distorting the data. In many cases, significant data distortion that is needed to preserve privacy could lead to inaccurate results. <br/>Due to the limitations of the current approaches, efficient and accurate privacy-preserving solutions are needed for handling large distributed data sets. To address this challenge, we design and develop a novel framework where sanitization and SMC techniques are integrated to develop efficient privacy-preserving solutions under resource constraints. Basically, we use the data sanitization techniques to get initial approximate results and carry out SMC operations selectively to increase the accuracy. Since we use existing techniques in a black box fashion, our approach is orthogonal to any new sanitization or SMC techniques.<br/>Our new techniques will substantially decrease the cost of executing privacy-preserving distributed data analytics protocols. This will have a direct economic impact by opening the way for new applications (e.g., e-health and e-government applications) that are at present considered infeasible due to the lack of necessary privacy-preserving solutions that can work efficiently on large data sets.

Abstract: Modern malware is used extensively in computer crime and cyber-warfare<br/>and poses a serious threat to the cyber-infrastructure of the United<br/>States, at the military, civil, and corporate levels. Malware can<br/>employ a number of techniques to gain access to needed resources and<br/>to prevent detection, including hooking or modifying system calls,<br/>adding new system calls, inserting new kernel modules, and directly<br/>patching kernel code. Furthermore, malware is increasingly stealthy,<br/>being both difficult to detect and to analyze, and current-generation<br/>schemes for detection, analysis, and mitigation will become<br/>increasingly ineffective as the trend toward additional stealth<br/>increases, with more esoteric infection vectors, complex packing<br/>schemes, polymorphism, and metamorphism being employed.<br/><br/>This proposal leverages emerging live digital forensics techniques, to<br/>create powerful techniques for malware detection and mitigation. These<br/>live forensics techniques deeply analyze memory dumps and build<br/>accurate models of kernel and application structures that reflect the<br/>state of the machine at the time of an investigation. By integrating<br/>live forensics techniques into a virtual machine monitor (VMM) and<br/>developing hardware-supported introspection techniques to analyze<br/>system state, malware detection facilities can be created that prevent<br/>malware from interfering with detection and mitigation strategies.<br/>The proposal discusses a number of necessary tasks to support this<br/>research agenda, including the design of and development of a<br/>hardware-assisted VMM introspection architecture and deep, portable<br/>modeling of kernel data structures and other guest VM state, including<br/>the filesystem. These modeling techniques can then be used for<br/>real-time verification of critical kernel code, cross-verification of<br/>kernel structures, application state analysis, and protection of<br/>critical system files. A novel aspect of the proposed research is the<br/>use of commodity Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), protected by<br/>hardware directed-I/O virtualization, as malware detection<br/>accelerators.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed research is to increase the<br/>depth, flexibility, and capabilities of introspected live forensics<br/>analysis and to expand the scope of live forensics to the detection of<br/>sophisticated malware. The proposed techniques expand<br/>state-of-the-art in live forensics techniques, virtual machine<br/>introspection, and kernel-level malware detection and will provide a<br/>foundation on which to build even more powerful techniques. The<br/>broader impacts of the proposed work touch all sectors of society,<br/>since individual citizens, as well as the law enforcement, military,<br/>and corporate communities all benefit from the deployment of more<br/>sophisticated malware detection mechanisms. The proposed work also<br/>enhances the existing curriculum in information assurance at the<br/>University of New Orleans, since research results from this effort<br/>will be incorporated into both undergraduate and graduate courses,<br/>exposing students to an important area of study in which the supply of<br/>practitioners falls far short of the demand.<br/><br/>For further information see the project web site at the URL<br/>http://www.cs.uno.edu/~golden/live-forensics.html.

Abstract: In phishing, an attacker tries to steal sensitive information, e.g., bank/credit card account numbers, login information, etc., from Internet users. The US society and economy are increasingly dependent on the Internet and the web, which is plagued by phishing. One popular phishing method is to create a site that mimics a good site and then attract users to it via email, which is by far the most popular medium to entice unsuspecting users to the phishing site. Because of this modus operandi and the damages caused by phishing, it is important to design efficient and effective classifiers for emails and web sites. <br/><br/>In this project, new techniques, inspired from natural language processing methods, are being designed for phishing email and web site detection. They are then implemented and validated rigorously on realistic data sets. They are also applied to automatic detection of opinion spam. <br/><br/>Proposed research is expected to: (i) be useful in pushing the envelope of natural language processing techniques, and (ii) yield new applications of these techniques in cyber security. In the past, the PI has been very successful in involving women and minorities including underrepresented minorities in his research and this effort will be continued in this project. University of Houston has been recognized as a Hispanic-serving institution and the PI will continue his past successful efforts to involve underrepresented minorities including African Americans and Hispanics in this research. This research will be moved into the classroom and broadly disseminated through publications and software on the web.

Abstract: Performing financial transactions on a smartphone raises a number of security concerns. How can a bank be certain that a request is authentic? How do we prevent the same transaction to be unintentionally repeated? How can we ensure your sensitive information cannot be copied even if a phone is lost? Strong hardware security functions such as device fingerprints and true random number generators are essential in addressing these questions. However, traditional hardware security functions are difficult and expensive to build. This project investigates using off-the-shelf Flash memory, which is already in most digital systems today, to provide security functions like device fingerprints, random number generators, and secure information storage. These security functions will be extracted in a plug-and-play fashion from today's Flash without any customized modification, enabling hardware-based security in virtually all electronic devices. Therefore, this project will greatly enhance security and privacy in an era where computing devices are everywhere. Also, the project will train and educate a new generation of interdisciplinary engineers who can understand both security and semiconductor device.<br/><br/>To enable the proposed security functions, this project taps into inherent analog behaviors of Flash memory such as hidden variations, noises, aging, etc. For example, random numbers can be generated from thermal or quantum noise in Flash memory. The device fingerprints can be extracted from program/erase timing variations of each memory cell, which cannot be predicted or controlled even by the Flash memory manufacturer. Information hiding can be achieved through selective stressing of bits to create probabilistic differences. Such hidden information will be very difficult to copy or even detect unless a specific secret key is known. These analog behaviors can be observed through the standard Flash memory interface without interfering with normal memory functions. Therefore, the proposed security functions will be broadly applicable to electronic systems with Flash memory.

Abstract: This project develops methods to provide citizens information about technologies that obstruct, restrict, or tamper with their access to information. Internet users need an objective, independent, third-party service that helps them determine whether their Internet service provider or government is restricting access to content, specific protocols, or otherwise degrading service. Towards this goal, we are (1) monitoring attempts to block or manipulate Internet content and communications; and (2) evaluating various censorship circumvention mechanisms in real-world deployments}. The project develops a large-scale measurement and monitoring service that measures network reachability and performance from a variety of access networks to various Internet services; infers whether ISPs or governments are restricting or otherwise throttling access to various applications and services; and detects attempts to tamper with information presented to users. The project also studyies the policy ramifications of making information about censorship and information tampering available to Internet users. It will provide up-to-date information about both the extent of censorship and information tampering in countries around the world and technologies countries are using to implement censorship and thwart censorship circumvention tools. Discoveries are disseminated through real-time portals and through regular written reports and academic publications.

Abstract: The Internet has transformed from a small non-profit network into a gigantic infrastructure that creates revenues measured in billions of dollars. Unfortunately, this has created an unprecedented pressure on the end user's privacy by trackers and information aggregators, because a user's profile is used to determine which personalized content (e.g., ads, search results, recommendations, etc.) will be served to the given user. The common goal of the trackers is to gather a more perfect user profile in an attempt to increase revenues from content personalization. Such user profiling can often be misused. For example, signs of price and search discrimination have been recently reported. Others argue that content personalization, which creates the so-called 'filter bubble' effect, has an even more profound impact on the society and in particular on the future of democracy.<br/><br/>The PI proposes endpoint user profile control as a comprehensive approach to the above personalization-induced problems. In the PI's approach, the user has the ability and means, which this project will develop, to explicitly define and implicitly control its profile at all possible trackers at once. The PI will develop and implement endpoint user profile controller as a thin sub-layer that 'sits' between the end-user and endpoint client applications. The controller imprints the desired user profiles by leaving controlled online footprints in the public domain, e.g., by actively visiting web pages from a set of selected topics, sending search queries semantically linked with the user-defined profile etc. This allows users to submit their preferences to all possible trackers they encounter, granting the user a single point of control over their profiles. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed research will address fundamental questions that are key to developing and deploying effective endpoint user profile control. The main challenges are how to effectively control numerous ad trackers at once and how to achieve this in a scalable and effective manner. The PI's focus will be on the control of (i) ad trackers, (ii) web site trackers, (iii) search engine trackers, (iv) social-network trackers, and (v) information aggregators. The PI will develop statistical methods to accurately evaluate the properties of these trackers in order to effectively control them. The proposed techniques range from statistical rule mining to developing comprehensive scoring, noise-reduction, and orthogonal probing algorithms that are necessary for effective control.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: By empowering the user to explicitly and comprehensively control his user profile on the Internet, the system will not only help users regain their online privacy, but also enhance human liberties and promote free and open society. This will be possible to achieve without scrutinizing the online advertising industry, which is effectively funding today's Internet. The proposed system is capable of achieving this goal in a realistic and feasible way, without the adoption of a complex infrastructure. The PI plans to design and disseminate endpoint user profile controller as easy-to-use browser extensions, plug-ins, and mobile applications, which will enable effective endpoint user profile control.

Abstract: Wireless connectivity has become the primary way most users access cyberspace. The wide use of the internet on wireless and mobile devices is further encouraged with new services that simultaneously engage and connect a large number of users. As a result, the society at large is quickly getting comfortable with the idea of conducting everyday lives on mobile devices most of which require communicating sensitive and confidential information over the wireless medium. Consequently, secure access to cyberspace necessitates wireless security. Wireless, being an open medium, is more prone to malicious cyber acts as compared to wired connectivity. On the other hand, this medium also presents unique opportunities to provide security guarantees through the interaction of nodes and advanced physical layer techniques. In particular, information theoretic security emerges with design insights that provide guaranteed security against computationally unlimited adversaries. In order to do so, information theory assumes a network of altruistic nodes and looks for fundamental performance limits which usually come with complex interaction and coordination requirements. The premise of this project is that this idealistic set-up can be successfully transformed into a practical one by amalgamating information theory with the theory of incentives in order to provide secure wireless cyber access.<br/><br/>Specific research topics being addressed include the development of: (1) mechanisms to incentivize non-altruistic cognitive nodes to participate in information theoretic security protocols; (2) incentive mechanisms for scenarios where all nodes have equal access to spectrum and need confidentiality, even from each other; (3) techniques for providing security to groups of cooperative nodes and the associated trust issues; (4) incentive mechanisms for combating active attacks; (5) strategies for combating colluding adversaries; and (6) mechanisms to ensure that nodes have the incentive to adopt a given security protocol.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this work include: (1) providing secure access to cyberspace via the wireless medium; (2) new design insights for practical security protocols; and (3) amalgamating information theory and game theory via incentive mechanisms. Educational broader impacts include: (1) dissemination of research results in the form of tutorials and short courses; (2) enhancing graduate-student research experiences via a three-university research exchange program; (3) incorporating the research results into graduate and undergraduate communications courses; and (4) recruitment of and mentorship for women in engineering and science.

Abstract: Progress in computer vision makes biometric authentication and recognition become more reliable and readily available than before, with a potential for ubiquitous use of such data well beyond traditional authentication. The need to protect highly sensitive biometrics is apparent, which, unlike other types of data used for authentication purposes, cannot be revoked and replaced with a new value. This means that any breach in security of biometric data has far reaching consequences to the individual than loss of other sensitive data.<br/><br/>Previously, only limited mechanisms for protecting privacy of biometry were available. To address the paucity of adequate protection mechanisms, this project develops novel techniques for enhancing privacy protection of biometric data when it is being processed and used in environments which are not fully trusted or secured in a broad set of contexts and applications that go well beyond comparing two biometric codes. The project's scope covers (i) secure interactive computation on biometric data, (ii) secure outsourcing of biometric computation to untrusted servers, and (iii) efficient verification of the correctness of the result of outsourced computation. A distinct benefit of this work is that it combines cryptographic design with practical evaluation on real biometric data, as well as includes integration of developed tools into a biometric computing grid environment. The outcomes of this research are expected to enable and promote safer practices in handing sensitive biometric data, including utilizing untrusted computing power, and a wider degree of collaboration between entities who are otherwise not permitted to share their data.

Abstract: As computing devices continue to be embedded in more and more physical devices, they are now privy to the most confidential information about our lives. The ability to safely keep a secret in memory is central to the vast majority of security systems, but storing and erasing these secrets is a difficult problem in the face of an attacker who can obtain unrestricted physical access to these devices and the underlying hardware. Depending on the memory technology, the very act of storing a 1 instead of a 0 can have physical side effects measurable even after the power has been cut. Through the development of a new class of architectures that measurably increase the difficulty of physical analysis this project is enabling systems that can be trusted even when physical control of the system is ceded to an adversary. Initial results indicate that the creation of an efficient scheme for memory protection is possible under which, even if an adversary is able to inspect the value of a stored bit with a probabilistic error of only 5%, the system will be able to prevent that adversary from learning any information about the original un-coded bits with 99.9999999999% probability. Over the long term this research will help to create the skills and tools that cyber-physical system engineers will need to develop pervasive trustworthy systems, and to ease the development of those mission critical systems that we all depend on for our safety and livelihood.

Abstract: This research is focused on the creation of new techniques and algorithms to support comprehensive analysis of Android applications. We have developed formally grounded techniques for extracting accurate models of smartphone applications from installation images. The recovery formalization is based on TyDe, a typed meta-representation of Dalvik bytecode (the code structure used by the Android smartphone operating system). In developing TyDe, we are formalizing the TyDe type inferencing, ill-formed bytecode structure management, and creating a generalized Dalvik-to-Java retargeting logic based on bytecode "instruction templates". <br/><br/>TyDe and the models they represent are being used to perform deep analysis of application structure to infer potential application behaviors that may harm users, their data, or the cellular or Internet infrastructure. In particular, these analyses support whole program analysis, reflection, and smartphone specific data flow analysis. Such analyses provide a means for evaluating an applications adherence to best security practices or organizational requirements by inspecting permission structures, component interfaces, and source code and library origins for signals of malicious behavior. The analysis techniques are being evaluated on a large corpus of real-world applications extracted from real application markets. <br/><br/>In the broadest view, this work is providing new avenues for researchers, industry, and consumers to assess potential dangers presented by applications retrieved from smartphone application markets, an advancing the state of the art in application program analysis.

Abstract: The ongoing effort to move data intensive computation to low-cost public clouds has been impeded by privacy concerns, as today's cloud providers offer little assurance for the protection of sensitive user data. This problem cannot be addressed by existing cryptographic techniques alone, which are often too heavyweight to manage the computation involving a large amount of data. As a result, many computing tasks have to be run on individual organizations? internal systems whenever they touch even a very small amount of sensitive information.<br/><br/>The research in this project seeks practical solutions to this critical security challenge. The PIs are working on an approach to split a computing job over a hybrid-cloud platform, delegating to a public cloud the computation over public data, while keeping the computation on sensitive data within a private cloud. <br/><br/>Specifically, the PIs are developing a privacy-aware MapReduce system, which transparently partitions a computing job and schedules its components across the public/private clouds according to the security levels of the data involved. The system is designed to achieve high security assurance and outsource most of its workload when possible, at small computational and communication overheads. It includes support for analyzing and transforming the code for legacy jobs as well as developing new jobs. We are also working to extend these techniques to facilitate other secure work-flow processing over hybrid clouds. This research involves industry collaborators and contributes to secure processing of a wide range of computing jobs, from commercial data analysis, to DNA analysis, to intrusion detection.

Abstract: Voice over IP (VoIP) over IEEE 802.11 based wireless networks leads to a promising all-IP platform provisioning economic high-quality voice services to mobile users anytime and anywhere. Due to the openness and distributed nature of the protocols involved in the VoIP over wireless, it becomes easy for malicious users to achieve their own gain or disrupt the service by deviating from the normal protocol behaviors. This project develops a real-time intrusion detection framework, requiring no modification to the relevant standard protocols. Analytical tools are also developed for guiding the detection system design for guaranteed performance.<br/><br/>This research is expected to significantly advance the state of the art of real-time intrusion detection for VoIP over 802.11 based wireless networks, through three complementary tracks: selfish behavior detection over the 802.11 protocol, session initiation protocol (SIP)-layer attacks and detections, and development of a cross-layer intrusion detection framework. On the education front, the proposed interdisciplinary research seamlessly integrates theoretical studies in the areas of Markov decision process, wavelet analysis, 802.11 protocol analysis, and traffic modeling, as well as computer simulation and testbed experiments, with the advantages of providing various training projects to undergraduate and graduate students with different interests. On the industry front, the success of this project will generate an intrusion detection framework for the VoIP over wireless networks with the advantages of robust detection performance, provable detection quality of service, and excellent extendibility for future intrusion detection techniques.

Abstract: The domain name system (DNS) protocol plays a significant role in operation of the Internet by enabling the bi-directional association of domain names with IP addresses. It is also increasingly abused by malware, particularly botnets, by use of: (1) automated domain generation algorithms for rendezvous with a command-and-control (C&C) server, (2) DNS fast flux as a way to hide the location of malicious servers, and (3) DNS as a carrier channel for C&C communications.<br/>This project explores the development of a scalable, hierarchical machine-learning stack, called HIMALAYAS, which specializes in algorithms for automatically mining DNS data for malware activity. In particular, we are interested in isolating both ordered and unordered sets of malware domain groups whose access patterns are temporally and logically correlated. <br/><br/>HIMALAYAS performs a task of increasing complexity at each level ? starting from scalable clustering and feature selection at lower levels, to more advanced malware domain subsequence identification algorithms at higher levels. It has multiple benefits, including speed, accuracy, interpretability, and ability to use domain knowledge, which makes it very well suited for malware analysis and related tasks. The analysis by HIMALAYAS should accelerate the identification and takedown of malware domains on the Internet and improve services such as Google SafeSearch. <br/><br/>The machine-learning stack developed as part of the HIMALAYAS project has broader application to many important data mining problems, e.g., in financial data analysis, and mining user patterns from web access logs. The project provides opportunities for students to participate in the development and transition of the technology.

Abstract: Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows an untrusted party to efficiently compute any compact function directly on ciphertexts. When made available over an untrusted cloud server, data is submitted and returned in encrypted form, and the execution remains secure against malicious users. Early FHE proposals had rather disappointing efficiencies. Recently new FHE schemes based on the difficulty of the learning with errors (LWE) problem emerged with orders of magnitude improvement over earlier constructions. This project addresses a variety of problems in engineering, computer science and mathematics all centered around the goal of bringing LWE-based homomorphic encryption techniques closer to practice which could impact the way society utilizes computing services.<br/><br/>The project team explores three research components. The first research component investigates algorithmic optimizations to speed up LWE-based schemes, and to develop optimized software implementations on CPUs and graphics processing units. Specifically, the investigators apply optimization techniques including changing the representation of the operands, batching, and precomputation. The team also aims to build a LWE-FHE based homomorphic instruction set. In another research component the project team develops application specific custom hardware to overcome inefficiencies of software platforms. Finally, we investigate the customization of parameters to match the needs of select lightweight cryptographic primitives.

The premise of this project is that this idealistic set-up can be successfully transformed into a practical one by amalgamating information theory with the theory of incentives in order to provide secure wireless cyber access.<br/><br/>Specific research topics being addressed include the development of: (1) mechanisms to incentivize non-altruistic cognitive nodes to participate in information theoretic security protocols; (2) incentive mechanisms for scenarios where all nodes have equal access to spectrum and need confidentiality, even from each other; (3) techniques for providing security to groups of cooperative nodes and the associated trust issues; (4) incentive mechanisms for combating active attacks; (5) strategies for combating colluding adversaries; and (6) mechanisms to ensure that nodes have the incentive to adopt a given security protocol.<br/><br/>Broader impacts of this work include: (1) providing secure access to cyberspace via the wireless medium; (2) new design insights for practical security protocols; and (3) amalgamating information theory and game theory via incentive mechanisms. Educational broader impacts include: (1) dissemination of research results in the form of tutorials and short courses; (2) enhancing graduate-student research experiences via a three-university research exchange program; (3) incorporating the research results into graduate and undergraduate communications courses; and (4) recruitment of and mentorship for women in engineering and science.

Abstract: The domain name system (DNS) protocol plays a significant role in operation of the Internet by enabling the bi-directional association of domain names with IP addresses. It is also increasingly abused by malware, particularly botnets, by use of: (1) automated domain generation algorithms for rendezvous with a command-and-control (C&C) server, (2) DNS fast flux as a way to hide the location of malicious servers, and (3) DNS as a carrier channel for C&C communications.<br/>This project explores the development of a scalable, hierarchical machine-learning stack, called HIMALAYAS, which specializes in algorithms for automatically mining DNS data for malware activity. In particular, we are interested in isolating both ordered and unordered sets of malware domain groups whose access patterns are temporally and logically correlated. <br/><br/>HIMALAYAS performs a task of increasing complexity at each level ? starting from scalable clustering and feature selection at lower levels, to more advanced malware domain subsequence identification algorithms at higher levels. It has multiple benefits, including speed, accuracy, interpretability, and ability to use domain knowledge, which makes it very well suited for malware analysis and related tasks. The analysis by HIMALAYAS should accelerate the identification and takedown of malware domains on the Internet and improve services such as Google SafeSearch. <br/><br/>The machine-learning stack developed as part of the HIMALAYAS project has broader application to many important data mining problems, e.g., in financial data analysis, and mining user patterns from web access logs. The project provides opportunities for students to participate in the development and transition of the technology.

Abstract: Third-party hardware Intellectual Property (IP), written as code in a Hardware Description Language (HDL), is extensively used in modern integrated circuits. Contemporary electronics typically include 75% of third party hardware IP and only 25% in-house design to provide customization or a profit-making edge. Such extensive use of third-party hardware IP in both commercial and military applications raises security and trustworthiness concerns, especially in today's globalized market. Malicious modifications to a module's HDL code may introduce vulnerabilities, jeopardizing the security of the larger system within which it is integrated. So how does one protect electronics from the threat of potentially tampered with third-party hardware IP? To this end, this project is developing a framework for facilitating acquisition of provably trustworthy microprocessor cores. Drawing concepts from software proof-carrying code (PCC), security-related properties are codified in a temporal logic to outline the boundaries of trusted operation. In the case of microprocessor cores, these security properties ensure that the microprocessor instruction set architecture (ISA) does not introduce malicious architectural state changes, thereby preventing attackers from using a programming interface to exploit maliciously introduced hardware modifications. A formal proof of these security properties is then crafted by the vendor and presented to the consumer, who can automatically check correctness and validate compliance to the security properties. An ecosystem for developing provably trustworthy microprocessor cores, including a foundations framework, libraries, software tools, and demonstrations, as well as an educational module on Trusted Integrated Circuits and Systems are being developed as part of this project.

Abstract: Application-level, aka ``flash-DDoS'' attacks are the most challenging form of distributed denial of service (DDoS). They flood the victim with legitimate-like service requests generated from numerous bots. There is no defense today that is even remotely effective against flash-DDoS attacks, thus such attacks are today a serious and unmitigated threat to any server.<br/><br/>Our project works on developing defenses against flash-DDoS attacks that can pinpoint traffic sent by automated bots and differentiate it from human-generated traffic. Bot IPs are then blacklisted and their traffic filtered protecting the server under attack without any damage to legitimate users. Our project develops novel technologies called ASTUTE (pASsive TUring TEsts) to distinguish bots from human users, by modeling three aspects of human user behavior: (1) dynamics of human-server interaction, (2) human preference for server content, and (3) human processing of visual and textual cues. IP addresses of detected bots will be blacklisted and their traffic will be dropped during server overload. ASTUTE technologies model human behavior without conscious human participation, thus performing Turing tests (human vs machine differentiation) transparently to humans. <br/><br/>We will implement all our code as extensions of popular open-source server platforms, such as Apache (for Web) and bind (for DNS). At the end of this work we will deliver working prototypes of these extensions, thus our research will directly transition into practice for any interested party at no cost to them. All our code will be released as open-source under the GNU GPL v3 license.

Abstract: Access control refers to mechanisms for protecting access to confidential information, such as sensitive medical data. Management of access control policies, in applications that involve several collaborating parties, poses several challenges. One of these is in ensuring that each party in such a collaboration only obtains the minimal set of access permissions that they require for the collaboration. In a domain such as healthcare, it may be critical that access be minimized in this way, rather than allowing all parties equal access to the sensitive information. In practice, it is often difficult to manage access control policies to achieve this goal of minimality. This research will investigate new approaches to describing and reasoning about access control policies, to ensure that information that is shared in collaborative applications is only accessible to those parties in the application that require it. This work will develop both the theoretical foundations of, and prototype tools for, ensuring end-to-end security of data that is shared between organizations, with sharing of medical data as a particular source for use-case scenarios.<br/><br/>On one dimension, the project will investigate the extension of workflow languages to describe protocols for sharing information in collaborate applications. On another dimension, relationship-based access control can describe access to information based on parties' roles in a collaboration. The project will investigate the use of spatial and temporal logics for relating these two, and user interfaces for presenting and reasoning about this information. Since ultimately software programs will perform the access and transfer of patient medical data, formal specifications will be extracted from workflow specifications, and used as a basis for checking software programs for their compliance with these access control policies. The broader impact of this research will be facilitated by the P.I.'s involvement with the NIH International Epidemiologic Databases on AIDS for Central Africa project (CA-IeDEA). The fruits of the research will be disseminated through interaction with open source communities involved in healthcare IT for low and middle income countries, as well as through interactions with lead healthcare IT decision-makers in the countries involved in CA-IeDEA.

Abstract: This collaborative research between Florida State University and Cornell University is to identify language-action features from text-based messages that can be used to dynamically infer a social actor's perceived trustworthiness. The team will investigate using optimal analysis techniques to calibrate trustworthiness reasoning, which can be used to computationally model actors' deceptive behaviors in cyber space and to infer actors' intent based on their words and actions.<br/><br/>This research will have a transformative impact in understanding the dynamics of trusting relationships through observing language-action features and psychosocial trustworthiness attribution mechanisms. This study serves as a precursor to a socio-technical schema that will facilitate national security and data protection for the general populace while also protecting the individual's right to privacy. This study will contribute to the science of cyber-security, and will help the cyber-security community to understand and enable trustworthy communication and collaborative information behavior among computer-mediated groups in a systematic way.

Abstract: This project studies Internet censorship as practiced by some of today's nation-states. The effort emphasizes analyzing the techncial measures used by censors to perform censorship, the extent to which their operations inflict collateral damage (unintended blocking, or blocking of activity wholly outside the censoring nation), and vulnerabilities due to the specifics of how censorship operates. Regarding this latter, we analyze flaws in either how the censorship monitoring detects particular network traffic to suppress, or in how the monitor then attempts to block or disrupt the target traffic. This facet of the research focuses on forms of monitoring that eavesdrop on network links, analyze copies of transmitted traffic, and then inject forged traffic, seemingly sent from one of the communication endpoints to the other, instructing the other party to cease communication. Such "on-path" monitoring is subject to a number of potential manipulations and evasions due to the inexact view the monitor has of the comunication as actually seen by the communicating parties. We in particular then work towards developing tools and changes to Internet technology that can resist these forms of disruption and thus enable users to access the Internet freely.

Abstract: This research is focused on the creation of new techniques and algorithms to support comprehensive analysis of Android applications. We have developed formally grounded techniques for extracting accurate models of smartphone applications from installation images. The recovery formalization is based on TyDe, a typed meta-representation of Dalvik bytecode (the code structure used by the Android smartphone operating system). In developing TyDe, we are formalizing the TyDe type inferencing, ill-formed bytecode structure management, and creating a generalized Dalvik-to-Java retargeting logic based on bytecode "instruction templates". <br/><br/>TyDe and the models they represent are being used to perform deep analysis of application structure to infer potential application behaviors that may harm users, their data, or the cellular or Internet infrastructure. In particular, these analyses support whole program analysis, reflection, and smartphone specific data flow analysis. Such analyses provide a means for evaluating an applications adherence to best security practices or organizational requirements by inspecting permission structures, component interfaces, and source code and library origins for signals of malicious behavior. The analysis techniques are being evaluated on a large corpus of real-world applications extracted from real application markets. <br/><br/>In the broadest view, this work is providing new avenues for researchers, industry, and consumers to assess potential dangers presented by applications retrieved from smartphone application markets, an advancing the state of the art in application program analysis.

Abstract: Award Abstract for CAREER proposal 0747541<br/><br/>In this project we design efficient secure algorithms for various multi-party protocol tasks. The protocols must be provably secure based on well-understood cryptographic assumptions, they need to satisfy requirements imposed by the real-world applications of these protocols, and they need to be efficient enough to be usable in practice.<br/><br/>Among the protocol tasks we address are private authentication schemes, aggregate signature schemes, dynamic group key agreement schemes, and proactive cryptosystems. The challenge in designing such protocols is to achieve efficiency without making assumptions that would impede the adoption of these protocols in practice. For example, protocols that rely on a public key infrastructure cannot assume universally trusted authorities, and they should remain efficient if protocol participants hold certificates from multiple sources. Moreover, to be truly useful a multi-party protocol must remain efficient in realistic communication conditions, e.g. if the participating nodes do not have synchronized clocks, or if the communication mechanism between any two protocol participants can be disrupted.<br/><br/>Development of efficient secure multi-party protocols which meet these efficiency goals and operational requirements relies on construction of public key primitives with novel security properties, and on finding new approaches to fundamental questions related to multi-party protocols, e.g. fairness, limitations imposed by trust assumptions, and security under protocol composition.<br/><br/>This project can also have an immediate impact on a variety of computer systems, improving their reliability, security, and privacy properties. Examples of prospective applications of our protocols are provision of fault-tolerant security services, and enabling of group-wide security mechanisms in ad-hoc and mobile networks.

Abstract: The ubiquity of computing technology and the Internet have created an age of big data that has the potential to greatly enhance the efficiency of our societies and the well-being of all people. The trend comes with problems that threaten to prevent or undermine the benefits. An immediate concern is how to fuse, integrate and analyze data while respecting privacy, security and usage concerns. A second issue is allowing data to remain distributed, enabling its owners to maintain and control quality as well as to enforce security and privacy policies. A final underlying challenge is helping to produce sound and useful results by assuring that systems understand the meaning of the data being integrated and analyzing access and usage policies. For some domains, like health informatics and clinical research, solving these problems will have a significant impact on society.<br/><br/>This project explores an approach to solving these problems by developing a policy-compliant integration system for linked healthcare data. The system models data, schemas and policies using open Web standards such as Semantic Web languages, federates queries to independent Linked Data stores based on content, provides policy enforcement by modifying incompliant queries, and uses formal methods to guarantee correctness of key components.<br/><br/>This project provides new approaches to solving one of the most significant problems our society faces in the 21st century: benefiting from the integration of distributed linked data while respecting security, privacy, and usage requirements. The prototype tools and systems are incorporated into our educational activities and made available to others via appropriate open source licenses.

Abstract: Mobile phones are in the midst of a dramatic transformation; they are becoming highly powerful sensor-rich software-controlled computing and communication devices. These "softphones" are increasingly entrusted with maintaining users' electronic identity, calendars, social networks, and even bank accounts. However, the vast increases in the flexibility of softphones comes with equally large security issues and opportunities, some of which we are only beginning to understand.<br/><br/>This project studies the new threats and promises of softphones, and focuses on identifying, understanding, and mitigating new security risks. Two broad risk categories are addressed: threats to individual users (such as user privacy or personal finances), and threats to the entire communication system (such as disruptions to emergency services). The project ultimately aims to understand how security problems associated with softphones and their networks are different from those of traditional computers and networks, and how to harness the unique capabilities of softphones for improved security.<br/><br/>The research is being conducted by a broad and diverse team of nine senior investigators, in collaboration with international industry and academic partners, under the aegis of the RISCS Center at Boston University. The project is striving for wide impact through a public seminar series, multiple workshops, course development in phone security across all levels (including honors courses), and cross-disciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students<br/><br/>The project's successful conclusion will deliver an essential and timely understanding of how to secure the mobile phone infrastructure that already manages many intimate aspects of our lives.

Abstract: The modernized Smart Grid (SG) is expected to enable several new applications such as dynamic pricing, demand response and fraud detection; however, collection of such fine-grained data raises privacy issues. This project aims to design and implement several novel mechanisms for securing data collection and communication in SG Advanced Metering Infrastructure applications while preserving user privacy when the data are to be accessed. The underlying communication infrastructure, namely Neighborhood Area Networks, is to be built with wireless mesh networks using the IEEE 802.11s, an IEEE 802.11 amendment for mesh networking. The project investigates user privacy preservation mechanisms using partially and fully homomorphic encryption during data collection in the Neighborhood Area Networks. For the collected data at the data repository, attribute-based access control mechanisms are studied. As part of these access control mechanisms, novel scalable key establishment and group key management schemes are investigated. A testbed consisting of IEEE 802.11 Linux routers is part of the project to assess the overhead of privacy mechanisms under quality of service constraints. <br/><br/>The testbed will be a community resource for researchers, educators and students as well as utility companies interested in SG communications and privacy. Ensuring practical user privacy solutions will increase the participation of customers in SG applications saving cost and energy. The testbed will be a great help to utilities, researchers and educators who work on SG communications. The software and technical manuals will be made available as open-source documents. New graduate courses on the Smart Grid will be introduced into the academic curriculum.

Abstract: One of the main impediment to a wider adoption of cloud storage and computing services is the need to keep data private. Recently, several research communities have begun exploring new techniques that allow a client to outsource storage and computation over private data to a potentially untrusted cloud service, while maintaining the privacy of the data. These techniques are highly varied depending on a large number of factors, like the ownership of the input and output data, the type of processing required, the desired level of protection, and the level of trust that the client is willing to put in different components of the outsourcing service. This highly collaborative project combines many different areas of expertise with the aim of substantially changing the way outsourced data and computation are perceived and used in the real world.<br/><br/>This project focuses on finding a modular approach to the specification, design and analysis of privacy preserving mechanisms in the context of outsourced computation. The investigators explore a broad solution space that combines algorithmic techniques, limited use of trusted hardware, and distributed computation and trust, and create a common framework that allows one to compare and analyze vastly different solutions in a modular and composable manner. The project will also explore the theoretical and practical limits of what each of these solutions can achieve and hone in on a practical solution that possibly combines many different techniques to achieve the right balance of efficiency and security.

Abstract: As the digital divide closes and more groups have access to the Internet, cybersafety is an increasingly relevant issue. With the connectivity provided by the Internet comes an inherent interdependency between devices connected to the Internet. Compromised devices are used in various forms of cybercrime (e.g., spam campaigns) that can affect the Internet as a whole. Thus, to increase cybersecurity, it is important to understand the ways and extent to which certain groups may be more susceptible to Internet crime. Previous studies have focused on how factors such as age, gender, occupation, and level of STEM background affect one?s susceptibility to Internet crime (i.e., phishing attacks), however little work has focused on how social class factors into Internet crime susceptibility. <br/><br/>This project focuses on understanding new sociological factors that may render particular groups more or less likely to be affected by cybercrime (in particular, phishing attacks that highlight opportunities for economic advancement). <br/><br/>The expected results from this project impact both the fields of cybersecurity and sociology. From a cybersecurity perspective, understanding whether particular demographics are disproportionately affected by online attacks can lead to: 1) efforts for prevention (e.g., Internet Service Providers that offer government subsidized broadband access can also provide cybersafety training); and 2) the identification of the spawning point of a cybercrime ecosystem, which if caught and addressed early, can make cyberspace at large more secure. Sociologically speaking, attention to whether social class influences susceptibility to cybercrime helps to highlight some of the previously understudied consequences of economic inequality.

Abstract: This research applies anthropological methods to study cybersecurity analysts working in Security Operation Centers (SOC). These analysts process large amounts of data while handling cyber threats. The job requires intelligence and high levels of skills but has many mundane/repetitive aspects. Adequate tool support is largely lacking and many of the skills and procedures involved are uncodified and undocumented resulting in a large body of "tacit knowledge." This project places researchers trained in both cybersecurity and anthropology into SOCs, working side by side with the analysts. This "participant observation" approach provides a means to access the tacit knowledge of the analysts and to convert it into more explicit knowledge, leading to the development of algorithms that can help automate the tasks. The ethnographic fieldwork also provides an opportunity to observe real security operation centers' work processes and identify factors that influence the effectiveness and efficiency with which cybersecurity incidents are handled. This helps to explain why some cybersecurity problems are hard to address in practice, what roles humans and organizational structures play, and where procedures might be inefficient or completely fail for non-technical reasons. The research is carried out through a collaborative effort involving researchers from Kansas State University and two companies. Results from the research will create practical tools that leverage tacit knowledge in security analytics and automate tasks such as incident response and forensic analysis. Research findings also inform the training of cybersecurity professionals by making explicit the tacit knowledge of effective security analytics acquired during participant observation.

Abstract: The modernized Smart Grid (SG) is expected to enable several new applications such as dynamic pricing, demand response and fraud detection; however, collection of such fine-grained data raises privacy issues. This project aims to design and implement several novel mechanisms for securing data collection and communication in SG Advanced Metering Infrastructure applications while preserving user privacy when the data are to be accessed. The underlying communication infrastructure, namely Neighborhood Area Networks, is to be built with wireless mesh networks using the IEEE 802.11s, an IEEE 802.11 amendment for mesh networking. The project investigates user privacy preservation mechanisms using partially and fully homomorphic encryption during data collection in the Neighborhood Area Networks. For the collected data at the data repository, attribute-based access control mechanisms are studied. As part of these access control mechanisms, novel scalable key establishment and group key management schemes are investigated. A testbed consisting of IEEE 802.11 Linux routers is part of the project to assess the overhead of privacy mechanisms under quality of service constraints. <br/><br/>The testbed will be a community resource for researchers, educators and students as well as utility companies interested in SG communications and privacy. Ensuring practical user privacy solutions will increase the participation of customers in SG applications saving cost and energy. The testbed will be a great help to utilities, researchers and educators who work on SG communications. The software and technical manuals will be made available as open-source documents. New graduate courses on the Smart Grid will be introduced into the academic curriculum.

Abstract: This project designs and deploys a multi-disciplinary framework to model spatial, temporal and social dynamics of cyber criminals. The framework fuses theories in both computer science and criminology. Specifically, project objectives are a) Apply and validate existing theories in the realm of general criminology (in particular Akers? social learning theory and Gottfredson and Hirschi?s general theory of crime) to study cyber crimes; b) Derive novel Internet usage features as fingerprints for cyber crimes; c) Design classification algorithms (based on multi-fractal analysis and petri-net designs) to subsequently model multiple dynamics of cyber criminals by integrating theoretical and practical outcomes from the above two objectives; and d) Extensively test and validate project outcomes. The core novelty of this project is in using real Internet data from subjects (initially a cyber savvy college sample) that is collected continuously, unobtrusively, while still preserving a high degree of privacy.<br/><br/><br/>Outcomes of this project will have far reaching impacts. It lays a foundation for fusing expertise in social sciences (specifically criminology) and cyber security, as a result of which existing theories in general criminology can be empirically tested for practical validity in studying cyber crimes. The identification of unique Internet fingerprints associating with cyber crimes will provide new insights into human centered aspects of cyber crimes, which is lacking today. The classification algorithms designed will provide cyber defenders with new tools to combat cyber crimes from multiple perspectives including prevention, detection, forensic investigations and prosecution.

Abstract: Coercion attacks that compel an authorized user to reveal his or her secret authentication credentials can give attackers access to restricted systems. The PIs are developing a new approach to preventing coercion attacks using the concept of implicit learning from cognitive psychology. Implicit learning refers to learning of patterns without any conscious knowledge of the learned pattern. Using a carefully crafted keyboard-based computer game the PIs plant a secret password in the participant's brain without the participant having any conscious knowledge of the trained password. This planted secret can be used for authentication, but participants cannot be coerced into revealing their secret since they have no conscious knowledge of it. <br/><br/>This project explores three directions for using implicit learning in computer security. First, the PIs are developing implicit learning tasks designed to be used in challenge-response authentication. Second, the PIs are experimenting with methods to demonstrate implicit knowledge by measuring electrical activity along the scalp using off the shelf EEG devices. Third, the PIs are conducting user experiments to demonstrate that participants are able to properly authenticate, but cannot consciously recognize the trained secret. This project is a collaboration between computer security researchers and cognitive psychologists. Ultimately, the project aims to understand how the brain represents implicit knowledge. This in turn will lead to new coercion resistant security mechanisms for high-security applications.

Abstract: The telephony system, which enabled near universal voice communication, has undergone a dramatic change due to technological advances and legal and regulatory changes. Although these changes offer many benefits, including low cost calling and richer functionality, they have introduced new vulnerabilities that can seriously undermine the trust people have in transactions conducted over the telephony channel. In fact, caller impersonation and social engineering over the phone are increasingly being used to commit fraud and steal credentials for online account takeovers. This project focuses on research that can help secure the emerging telephony landscape against these and other emerging threats. To better understand security threats, the project first explores the feasibility of using a telephony honeypot for characterizing the sources and nature of unwanted and malicious calls, and the vulnerabilities exploited by these calls. Based on an understanding of these threats and vulnerabilities, new techniques are investigated to combat and mitigate telephony based attacks. For example, to address call metadata manipulation, features embedded into the call audio itself are investigated, which can potentially be used to establish the source of a call in a more robust manner. The project also seeks to understand cross channel malicious activity in which attackers utilize both the web and telephony channels to devise and mount sophisticated attacks. <br/><br/>Telephony has been a trusted channel in the past and the project explores how trustworthy communication can be enabled in the future when voice communication will increasingly be integrated with our other online activities.

Abstract: The main impediment to a wide adoption of outsourcing storage and computing services is the need to keep the client's data private. Clients may directly own the data, or it can belong to third parties such as customers of the client in which case there may be a contractual or legal obligation to keep this data private. The data may be outsourced to external services due to it enormity or due to the complexity of the computations to be performed on the data. This project investigates how to design secure and private database services so they can be integrated within a larger design of secure systems. The broad impact of this work is new methods to ensure the private manipulations of large data sets in an efficient and easy to integrate manner, which is of vital importance to enable utilization of cloud services. <br/><br/><br/>The investigators study mechanisms that allow one to privately outsource large amounts of data to the cloud and privately execute various computations over this data. The data may change over time which will require the design of efficient methods to update the data while maintaining its privacy which do not increase dramatically with the size of the database. The project focuses on the composability of the security guarantees provided, so as to ensure that the overall privacy and security guarantees of a service can be deduced from the properties of its components.

Abstract: This project tackles the social and economic elements of Internet security: how the motivations and interactions of attackers, defenders, and users shape the threats we face, how they evolve over time, and how they can best be addressed. While security is a phenomenon mediated by the technical workings of computers and networks, it is ultimately a conflict driven by economic and social issues that merit a commensurate level of scrutiny. Today's online attackers are commonly profit-seeking, and the implicit social networks that link them together play a critical role in fostering the innovation and the efficiency underlying cybercrime markets. Further, the socio-economic lens can provide vital insights not only for understanding attackers, but victims too. Today's consumers, corporations, and governments make large investments in security technology with little understanding of their ultimate return-on-investment. And the ease with which we adopt online personas and relationships has created a collective blind spot that attackers exploit all-too-easily.<br/><br/>Grappling with these socio-economic dimensions is of fundamental importance for achieving a secure future information infrastructure, and developing a sound understanding of them requires research grounded in empiricism. Accordingly, the project has four key components: (1) pursue in-depth empirical analyses of a range of online criminal activities; (2) map out the evolving attacker ecosystem that preys on online social networks, and the extent to which unsafe online behavior is itself adopted and transmitted; (3) study how relationships among these criminals are established, maintained, and evolve over time; and (4) measure the efficacy of today's security interventions, both in the large and at the level of individual users. Across all of these efforts, the aim is to identify bottleneck elements where interventions might most effectively undermine entire ecosystems of abusive and criminal activities. Consequently, this research has the potential to dramatically benefit society by undermining entire cybercrime ecosystems: disrupting underground activities, infrastructure, and social networks through strategic intervention. The work will also create numerous educational opportunities, including undergraduate and graduate education as well as workforce education for security professionals, law enforcement, civil regulatory agencies, and legal scholars and professionals tasked with countering modern Internet threats.

Abstract: This project develops methods to provide citizens information about technologies that obstruct, restrict, or tamper with their access to information. Internet users need an objective, independent, third-party service that helps them determine whether their Internet service provider or government is restricting access to content, specific protocols, or otherwise degrading service. Towards this goal, we are (1) monitoring attempts to block or manipulate Internet content and communications; and (2) evaluating various censorship circumvention mechanisms in real-world deployments}. The project develops a large-scale measurement and monitoring service that measures network reachability and performance from a variety of access networks to various Internet services; infers whether ISPs or governments are restricting or otherwise throttling access to various applications and services; and detects attempts to tamper with information presented to users. The project also studyies the policy ramifications of making information about censorship and information tampering available to Internet users. It will provide up-to-date information about both the extent of censorship and information tampering in countries around the world and technologies countries are using to implement censorship and thwart censorship circumvention tools. Discoveries are disseminated through real-time portals and through regular written reports and academic publications.

Abstract: End-users' online behavior can significantly affect the reliability and security of next-generation software systems. For instance, skipping repeated requests to update software or ignoring security warnings while visiting unknown websites, while extremely dangerous, are not uncommon. Although end-users' actions (or inactions) often open up the opportunity for cyber-attacks, the lack of emotional appeals and poor design of the current software update/warning messages are to blame to a large extent for such risky behavior, which is addressed as follows. First, this project identifies the limitations of the current software update/warning messages from an affective-cognitive perspective, and addresses the shortcomings by incorporating emotional appeals that command attention and evoke emotions more effectively. Also, message designs are changed adaptively based on the context and user's past behavior to counter the habituation-effect. Finally, to increase the compliance rate, this project develops emotional education and inoculation strategies that enable users to recognize and avoid the temptation associated with risky online behavior. Successful completion of this project will greatly advance the understanding of the impact of emotion on the decision making process in regards to safe online behavior, and will revolutionize the way software vendors communicate the risks of running vulnerable software and warn users. The research findings will be published in premier academic venues, and will be disseminated through project website. Research agendas will be integrated with the curriculum development activities. Existing programs at UConn will be leveraged to promote diversity and engage students from underrepresented communities.

Abstract: Cloud computing is growing at exponential rates due to its great benefits to virtually all companies relying on IT systems. The biggest concern preventing further cloud adoption is data security and privacy. The main security principle in the design of cloud servers has been virtual isolation which ignores information leakage through subtle channels shared by the processes running on the same physical hardware. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to explore side-channel leakage on virtualized machines that form the cloud. By utilizing a cloud testbed, this project explores interactions of the underlying hardware, virtualization platforms, and cryptographic software. A better understanding of side-channel leakages is aiding the design of effective countermeasures. To facilitate effective transition to practice the project is taking a pragmatic approach by focusing on commonly used cryptographic software libraries which lie at the heart of virtually any security solution. To address identified weaknesses in existing crypto libraries, countermeasures in the form of patches will be released, ensuring the security of cloud servers.<br/><br/>The project resolves weaknesses in cryptographic software by issuing updates with immediate benefits to virtually all cloud customers. The impact is further amplified by the continuing rapid growth of cloud adoption. By understanding the vulnerabilities in virtualized systems, the project raises awareness in the software security community. By integration of results into existing curricula, the project aids training future cybersecurity experts at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

Abstract: Perhaps the greatest single impediment to the broad adoption of public clouds is concerns about security. Reasoning about all the security aspects of complex modern information systems is enormously difficult. Security is especially problematic in the cloud, where a customer must place their trust in opaque complicated services that they do not understand or control and that are shared with many other customers. Yet, in today's public clouds, the assumption is that providers of cloud services can be fully trusted to provide systems secure against any threat. An architecture that exposes the security properties of the underlying services will enable a community of researchers to innovate in the implementation of secure cloud services. It will also provide customers visibility and control of the security in the services they use. Confidence in the security of the cloud will enable transformational societal benefits as the massive public cloud infrastructure becomes more broadly adopted.<br/><br/>This project defines a modular security architecture for cloud services where providers of different services each expose the security properties of their service, and the consumer can construct a compositional service that matches their application requirements and then reason about the security of the compositional service. The investigators extend existing cloud infrastructures to support this architecture, and explore secure modular networking and operating system technologies in the context of this architecture.

Abstract: Computerized systems are present in various aspects of modern society. These systems are used to access and share confidential information. Such sharing is achieved through cryptographic protocols which often employ randomization to introduce unpredictability in their behavior to achieve critical security objectives and make it difficult for the malicious adversaries to infer the underlying execution of the participants. It is imperative to ensure that these protocols meet their security objectives such as confidentiality, privacy, fair exchange, anonymity and availability, as serious flaws have often been discovered in widely used cryptographic protocols. Given the ubiquitous role played by these security protocols and the socio-economic-political consequences that incorrect designs of cryptographic protocols may have, reasoning about their correctness is an important social imperative. This task is challenging because of the presence of malicious adversaries on the Internet as well as the subtle interaction between the concurrent nature of Internet and the various features such as cryptography and randomization used by the protocols. Hence, the development of automated techniques to verify their correctness is needed to manage this complexity, and this is the focus of this project.<br/><br/>The presence of randomization introduces subtle challenges in verifying the correctness of security protocols. In particular, when reasoning about adversarial behavior, one must only consider those behaviors in which the scheduling of actions of the adversary is independent of the private random choices of the individual participants. This project aims to develop scalable techniques and tools that faithfully, and automatically verify randomized cryptographic protocols by considering only attacks (by an adversary) that are oblivious of the private data and private coin tosses of protocol participants. There are primarily three research tasks identified in this project. First, theoretical completeness results will be established that will reduce the general security problem for unbounded protocol sessions, session identifiers, and messages to the finite bounded cases. The other two tasks will be devoted to making the finite bounded case more amenable to automation. In the second research task, we will develop automated techniques to verify safety properties of protocols based on new symmetry reduction techniques using SMT solvers. The third research task will develop automated techniques for verifying indistinguishability properties of protocols. We will investigate symmetry reduction techniques using SMT solvers for this task as well.

Abstract: Objective: <br/>The objective of this project is to investigate the scientific and technological foundations on time, location and integrity of sensor recordings, by exploiting novel intrinsic fingerprints in the environment. An example is the small random-like fluctuations of the electricity frequency known as the Electric Network Frequency (ENF). These environmental fingerprints reflect the attributes and conditions of the power grid and become naturally "embedded" into video, audio or other types of sensor signals at the time of recording. They carry time and location information and may facilitate integrity verification of the primary sensing data. Answering questions about the time, location, and integrity of sensor recordings find important applications in crime solving, counter-terrorism, journalism, infrastructure monitoring, smart grid management, and other commercial operations.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: <br/>The intellectual merit lies on exploring the nearly unchartered research area of forensic evidences in the environment, by drawing synergy across multiple disciplines including signal processing, machine learning, sensor circuits and systems, power engineering, and information forensics/security. The research exploration and technology development of this project are transformative and interdisciplinary in nature.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: <br/>The broader impacts are two folds: through engaging students, especially female and under-represented ones, in exploratory research, the project's seamless integration of research with education and outreach will prepare the future generation of engineering workforce with interdisciplinary strength; through new technologies and tools developed to advance information forensics, the project has a high potential to benefit a number of applications of global and societal importance.

Abstract: Many compelling applications involve computations that require sensitive data from two or more individuals. For example, as the cost of personal genome sequencing rapidly plummets many genetics applications will soon be within reach of individuals such as comparing one?s genome with the genomes of different groups of participants in a study to determine which treatment is likely to be most effective. Such comparisons could have tremendous value, but are currently infeasible because of the privacy concerns both for the individual and study participants. What is needed is a way to produce the result of the comparison without exposing either party's private inputs. The ultimate aim of this project is to make privacy-preserving computation practical and accessible enough to be used routinely in applications such as personalized genetics, medical research, and privacy-preserving biometrics.<br/><br/>Theoretical solutions to this problem, known as secure multi-party computation, have been known for several decades, including a general solution developed by Andrew Yao based on garbled circuits. Because of its extensive memory use and computational cost, however, the garbled circuits approach has traditionally been considered more of a theoretical curiosity than a practical mechanism for building privacy-preserving applications. Recent developments in cryptographic techniques and new implementation approaches are beginning to change this, however, and admit the possibility of scalable, practical secure computation. This project is designing methods for avoiding the memory bottleneck associated with garbled circuit evaluation by aggressively pipelining circuit generation and evaluation, and exploring a variety of techniques for reducing the size of garbled circuits. Another issue the limits the use of secure computation in practice is the need for standard protocols to assume an honest-but-curious adversary who always follows the specified protocol. This project is developing new techniques for dealing with malicious adversaries, improving the standard cut-and-choose and commit-and-prove approaches by using new cryptographic tools and exploring an alternate model in which a verifiable trusted party generates the circuit but is not trusted with any private data. The project is also developing techniques to audit the information that can be inferred from the result of a secure computation. Another goal is to make secure computation more accessible to developers by developing programming tools for defining secure computations at a high level, based on information-flow analysis and program partitioning.

Abstract: The objective of this research is to develop a theory of ?ActionWebs?, that is, networked embedded sensor-rich systems, which are taskable for coordination of multiple decision-makers. The approach is to first identify models of ActionWebs using stochastic hybrid systems, an interlinking of continuous dynamical physical models with discrete state representations of interconnection and computation. Second, algorithms will be designed for tasking individual sensors, based on information objectives for the entire system. Third, algorithms for ActionWebs will be developed using multi-objective control methods for meeting safety and efficiency objectives. Two grand challenge applications for this research are in Intelligent Buildings for optimal heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and lighting based on occupant behavior and external environment; and Air Traffic Control for mobile vehicle platforms with sensor suites for environmental sensing to enable safe, convenient, and energy efficient routing. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this research stems from a conceptual shift of ActionWebs away from passive information gathering to an action-orientation. This involves: modeling of ActionWebs using stochastic hybrid systems; taskable, multi-modal, and mobile sensor webs; and multi-scale action-perception hierarchies. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the research is in two grand challenge national problems: energy efficient air transportation, and energy efficient, high productivity buildings, and will tackle social, privacy, economic, and usability issues. Integrated with the research is a program of coursework development in networked embedded systems, across stove pipes in EECS, Aero-Astro, Civil, and Mechanical Engineering departments. Outreach objectives include new course design at San Jose State University, and recruiting more women researchers.

Abstract: Data provenance refers to the history of the contents of an object and its successive transformations. Knowledge of data provenance is beneficial to many ends, such as enhancing data trustworthiness, facilitating accountability, verifying compliance, aiding forensics, and enabling more effective access and usage controls. Provenance data minimally needs integrity assurance to realize these benefits. Additionally, provenance data may need assurances of confidentiality (e.g., protect the identity of a reviewer in a blinded paper review process from the authors but not from the editor) or of privacy (e.g., do not disclose identity of a source without the source's consent). In the past decade there has been significant progress regarding the structure and representation of provenance data as a directed acyclic graph. However, currently there is no overarching, systematic framework for the security and privacy of provenance data and their tradeoffs with respect to the utility of provenance data. The development of such a framework is recognized as one of a handful of promising thrusts in recent reports on Federal game-changing R&D for cyber security, particularly aligned with the theme of Tailored Trustworthy Spaces.<br/><br/>This project is to develop a comprehensive technical and scientific framework to address the security and privacy challenges of provenance data, and the attendant tradeoffs, so that our society can gain maximum benefit from applications of provenance data. Detailed foundational research is to be performed on security enhanced data models, access control and usage models, privacy including annonymization and sanitization, integrity, accountability and risk management techniques for provenance data. This foundational research is complemented by data provenance case studies in scientific and cyber security information sharing, and construction of prototype data provenance systems at the operating systems and data layers. Moreover, reference architectures and definitions of corresponding provenance management services are to be defined, identifying how these services can be effectively deployed in enterprises, and developing a risk-management framework to guide application architects, designers and users to effectively embed data provenance in their specific context. The project results will beneficially impact society at large by increasing trustworthiness of data acquired, transmitted and processed by computer systems. From the educational side, both theory and practice of data provenance are to be integrated in the undergraduate and graduate training of students, including underrepresented minority and female students, in all the collaborative institutions of this project.

Abstract: Current worldwide trends towards remote data storage solutions such as cloud storage, in which large stores of data on insecure networks must be efficiently accessible, and increasing security requirements emphasized the need to support efficient search functionality on large encrypted databases. Searchable encryption is a balancing act of efficiency, functionality, and security. The solutions either require extensive interaction and computation, linear data scan on each query, which is prohibitive for large databases, or knowing all data in advance. This research advances the state of the art of efficiently-searchable encryption (ESE) by focusing on three key areas: new security guarantees for order-preserving encryption, searchable encryption for fuzzy queries, and seeking a general definition of ESE. <br/><br/>The PI has conducted a cryptographic study of order-preserving encryption for supporting efficient range queries on remote encrypted data. This project clarifies the security guarantees of the previous definition and studies the alternative settings in order to develop new secure solutions. This research focuses on fuzzy queries which return database elements that correspond to messages which are close to the underlying queried message. This work initiates the first formal cryptographic study of fuzzy searchable encryption (FSE). In particular, the work focuses on developing appropriate security definitions and building provably-secure FSE schemes. This research seeks a general definition that will cover all known types of ESE, and investigates related impossibility issues. The research extends security definitions for various ESE to security of the database as a whole.

Abstract: Computer systems security is an arms race between defenders and<br/>attackers that has mainly been confined to software<br/>technologies. Increases in the complexity of hardware and the rising<br/>number of transistors per chip have created opportunities for<br/>hardware-based security threats. Among the most pernicious are<br/>malicious hardware footholds inserted at design time, which an<br/>attacker can use as the basis of a computer system attack.<br/><br/>This project explores of the feasibility of foothold attacks and a<br/>fundamental design-time methodology for defending against them.<br/>First, this project looks at techniques for highlighting potentially<br/>malicious circuits in a design automatically. The basic algorithm,<br/>called dead circuit identification (DCI), analyzes hardware<br/>description language source code and dynamic execution traces of<br/>design verification tests to identify suspicious circuitry whose<br/>results do not impact the computation.<br/><br/>The second aspect of this project is a system for removing suspicious<br/>circuits from a design automatically. The dead circuit elimination<br/>(DCE) tool removes suspicious circuits from a design by pushing<br/>potentially malicious logic up to a higher layer where it can be<br/>analyzed in more detail at runtime.<br/><br/>The third aspect of this project is a new technique for generating<br/>test cases and perturbing existing test cases to search specifically<br/>for potentially malicious circuits.<br/><br/>This project provides a pathway to detection and defense against<br/>security risks from hardware comprising attacks, making the enormous<br/>disruptions possible with such attacks far more difficult than today.

Abstract: Mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) allow users to execute rich third-party applications that are capable of making extensive use of device hardware and personal data. This poses security risks, as applications may perform undesirable operations such as deleting data, damaging hardware, or even directly incurring charges on the user's phone bill. Mobile devices also pose privacy risks, as they store sensitive personal information that may be accessed and shared inappropriately.<br/><br/>Empowering users to decide how resources on their mobile devices are accessed (i.e., "granting permission") is an important challenge for the future of mobile computing. Our research has shown that existing mechanisms are ineffective: users frequently grant permissions because they either do not understand them, are habituated to them, or feel that they have no other choice. This research project aims to identify and study potential solutions to these problems.<br/><br/>This project develops a user-centered approach to mobile device permission requests. The project is conducting human-subjects experiments to design and validate more effective mechanisms for regulating privacy- or security-sensitive actions. The research agenda involves minimizing habituation to security warnings by substituting them with protected widgets (i.e., "trusted UI") or audit mechanisms, when possible; improving the design of security warnings, because alternative permission-granting mechanisms are sometimes inappropriate; and integrating these mechanisms into a platform that improves system security by taking a user-centered approach to granting permissions. If successful, this project could help develop a secure foundation for future generations of mobile devices.

Abstract: A wealth of data about individuals is constantly accumulating in various databases in the form of medical records, social network graphs, mobility traces in cellular networks, search logs, and movie ratings, to name only a few. There are many valuable uses for such datasets, but it is difficult to realize these uses while protecting privacy. Even when data collectors try to protect the privacy of their customers by releasing anonymized or aggregated data, this data often reveals much more information than intended. To reliably prevent such privacy violations, we need to replace the current ad-hoc solutions with a principled data release mechanism that offers strong, provable privacy guarantees. Recent research on DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY has brought us a big step closer to achieving this goal. Differential privacy allows us to reason formally about what an adversary could learn from released data, while avoiding the need for many assumptions (e.g. about what an adversary might already know), the failure of which have been the cause of privacy violations in the past. However, despite its great promise, differential privacy is still rarely used in practice. Proving that a given computation can be performed in a differentially private way requires substantial manual effort by experts in the field, which prevents it from scaling in practice. <br/><br/>This project aims to put differential privacy to work---to build a system that supports differentially private data analysis, can be used by the average programmer, and is general enough to be used in a wide variety of applications. Such a system could be used pervasively and make strong privacy guarantees a standard feature wherever sensitive data is being released or analyzed. Specific contributions will include ENRICHING THE FUNDAMENTAL MODEL OF DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY to address practical issues such as data with inherent correlations, increased accuracy, privacy of functions, or privacy for streaming data; DEVELOPING A DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, along with a compiler that can automatically prove programs in this language to be differentially private, and a runtime system that is hardened against side-channel attacks; and SHOWING HOW TO APPLY DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY IN A DISTRIBUTED SETTING in which the private data is spread across many databases in different administrative domains, with possible overlaps, heterogeneous schemata, and different expectations of privacy. The long-term goal is to combine ideas from differential privacy, programming languages, and distributed systems to make data analysis techniques with strong, provable privacy guarantees practical for general use. The themes of differential privacy are also being integrated into Penn's new undergraduate curriculum on Market and Social Systems Engineering.

Abstract: Hardware components can contain malicious, illegal modifications that can siphon sensitive information to transmit to adversaries or shutdown critical operations. Such modifications to the hardware - the root of trust in computing - can compromise trustworthiness of systems. A malicious modification (backdoor) can find its way into a design through a core component implemented by a malicious insider on the team, or through a third-party intellectual property (IP). This research investigates techniques to build trustworthy hardware systems even with such untrustworthy, malicious hardware components.<br/><br/>A key insight used in this study is that while a large number of digital backdoor implementations are feasible they can be all classified into four simple categories with unique behavioral characteristics that can be leveraged to thwart backdoors. Digital backdoors can only be triggered in two ways: they must turn-on after certain amount of time or by specially crafted inputs. This classification is complete because time and data are the only two ways a digital system can change. After a backdoor is woken up it can impact the infested hardware component in only two ways: it can cause the hardware component to produce extraneous outputs or corrupt existing outputs. Backdoor detection techniques monitor the outputs of hardware units for anomalous behavior while protection techniques scramble inputs making it infeasible for the backdoor to be triggered at runtime. Hardening both the inputs and outputs of a hardware module against backdoors provides comprehensive protection and provides a strong basis, for the first time, to certify digital hardware to be free of backdoors. Such certification can significantly enhance the state of trustworthy computing

Abstract: As mobile phones become capable of performing increasingly complex and sensitive tasks, the loss, theft or destruction of such devices represents one of the most significant classes of security problems. This research improves the security of data stored on and generated by these devices by breaking the mandatory binding between mobile phones and hardware. In particular, this work limits the damage associated with this class of vulnerabilities not to the value of the data they transport but to the cost of the device itself. In this system, mobile phone users can seamlessly migrate software images of their phone to any device at their disposal, while data present on previously used devices is automatically encrypted or securely deleted. Phone images themselves are efficiently pushed into and pulled from the cloud, which also supports patching and the upgrade of phone images to occur both over the air and within the cloud itself, increasing the speed with which software vulnerabilities can be mitigated. In so doing, this approach allows network providers and users to adopt highly dynamic responses to security incidents.

Abstract: Despite a decade of research, the problem of securing the Internet's interdomain routing system is far from solved. For a long time, it seemed there was a problem of technical feasibility; research focused on designing more and more lightweight protocols, by reducing computational or communication overheads, or considering weaker security guarantees. It has now become clear that the challenge of deploying these protocols is not one of technical feasibility, but one of incentives. The Internet is a complex, distributed system that is not controlled by any one entity, but instead has thousands of players with different economic incentives. The real challenge is to create incentives for these players to band together and deploy a secure routing protocol that will significantly improve the reliability and security of the Internet.<br/><br/>To address this challenge, this project develops: (a) Metrics for measuring the utility of different network security protocols, (b) Algorithms that identify a target set of Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the Internet that should be initially convinced or incentivized to adopt the new security protocols, so that the rest of the Internet has the incentive to follow suit, (c) Guidelines for using secure routing protocols when they are partially deployed in the Internet, (d) Models for evaluating improvements in security as ASes gradually deploy the protocol. The approaches in this project combine domain knowledge and validation on real network data, with problem formulations inspired by emerging ideas from cryptography, game theory, and the literature on social networks.

Abstract: Our society is becoming increasingly reliant on powerful and interconnected computing devices that store much of our personal information. These devices present an ever-growing tension between the desire for our personal information to be private, and the desire to put our personal information to good use for our own convenience. In cryptography, problems that involve requirements of useful computation and privacy are understood through the lens of secure multi-party computation (SMPC). Specifically, SMPC refers to the problem of how mutually distrusting parties can securely and collaboratively perform tasks that involve private information.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI will develop new techniques for understanding and overcoming the challenges and limitations posed by SMPC protocols. In particular, the following major themes will be explored: (1) is it possible in the real world to design protocols that remain secure regardless of other concurrently running protocols? (2) what security properties can be embedded into objects like ciphertexts and digital signatures? (3) how can shared data be maintained persistently while remaining private? The PI will develop new materials for undergraduate courses in cryptography and algorithms, based on principles of pedagogically sound visualization. The PI will also create resources for the cryptography research community, in the form of an online database of cryptographic constructions and primitives.

Abstract: This project studies higher-level abstractions for constructing distributed<br/>systems that integrate information and computation across administrative and<br/>trust domains. Current practice does not offer general, principled techniques<br/>for implementing these systems securely. To develop these techniques,<br/>fundamental problems of security, consistency, performance, and system<br/>evolution are being explored. Problems studied include automatic, adaptive,<br/>secure partitioning of programs and data across the nodes of a distributed<br/>system; new authorization logics for efficiently managing trust<br/>relationships in a distributed system; new methods for increasing<br/>performance of distributed systems while guaranteeing strong data<br/>consistency; and new ways to securely and consistently evolve the structure<br/>of persistent information.<br/><br/>These topics are being studied in the context of Fabric, a new platform for<br/>secure distributed computation. Fabric is intended to support secure<br/>integration of information systems, a valuable capability for many application<br/>domains, including in medicine, finance, education, government, and the<br/>military. For example, good methods for integrating distributed information<br/>systems would support secure sharing of medical records between institutions.

Abstract: This project tackles the social and economic elements of Internet security: how the motivations and interactions of attackers, defenders, and users shape the threats we face, how they evolve over time, and how they can best be addressed. While security is a phenomenon mediated by the technical workings of computers and networks, it is ultimately a conflict driven by economic and social issues that merit a commensurate level of scrutiny. Today's online attackers are commonly profit-seeking, and the implicit social networks that link them together play a critical role in fostering the innovation and the efficiency underlying cybercrime markets. Further, the socio-economic lens can provide vital insights not only for understanding attackers, but victims too. Today's consumers, corporations, and governments make large investments in security technology with little understanding of their ultimate return-on-investment. And the ease with which we adopt online personas and relationships has created a collective blind spot that attackers exploit all-too-easily.<br/><br/>Grappling with these socio-economic dimensions is of fundamental importance for achieving a secure future information infrastructure, and developing a sound understanding of them requires research grounded in empiricism. Accordingly, the project has four key components: (1) pursue in-depth empirical analyses of a range of online criminal activities; (2) map out the evolving attacker ecosystem that preys on online social networks, and the extent to which unsafe online behavior is itself adopted and transmitted; (3) study how relationships among these criminals are established, maintained, and evolve over time; and (4) measure the efficacy of today's security interventions, both in the large and at the level of individual users. Across all of these efforts, the aim is to identify bottleneck elements where interventions might most effectively undermine entire ecosystems of abusive and criminal activities. Consequently, this research has the potential to dramatically benefit society by undermining entire cybercrime ecosystems: disrupting underground activities, infrastructure, and social networks through strategic intervention. The work will also create numerous educational opportunities, including undergraduate and graduate education as well as workforce education for security professionals, law enforcement, civil regulatory agencies, and legal scholars and professionals tasked with countering modern Internet threats.

Abstract: This project targets an important aspect of online privacy by giving users the ability to hide their communication patterns through anonymous communication. Anonymous communication mitigates the "dossier effect," where third parties can accumulate enough information about users to construct a detailed profile, regardless of the use of encryption. This project addresses two key research issues in anonymous communication: scale and performance. To support large user bases, it is necessary to redesign the current centralized architecture of anonymous communication systems and replace it with a peer-to-peer one. The project studies the myriad security, privacy, and performance issues introduced by such a change. Better performance will improve the usability of anonymous communication to make it a reasonable option for routine Internet use. The ultimate goal is to make anonymity technology accessible to all people for appropriate uses and to integrate it into basic Internet protocols.

Abstract: Information-theoretic security is the science of safeguarding information across a communication network based on the use of concepts and techniques in information theory. It encompasses protection against eavesdropping, impersonation, and substitution attacks made by potential adversaries present in the network. Whereas eavesdropping and impersonation attacks (and solutions) are well studied, substitution attacks, in which the adversary replaces messages from a source by different valid messages from the same source, present new risks in an increasingly networked world. This work explores how it is possible to make use of side information that is often available in a typical communication network to check against substitution attacks made directly on raw messages by potential adversaries in the network. This frees the process of guaranteeing information integrity of the messages from the requirements of secrecy and authentication, and better isolates the mathematical structure that leads to information integrity in relation to the network topology. <br/><br/>The separation principle developed in this work then allows one to more easily incorporate secrecy and authentication back into the overall information-theoretic security design. The broader implications of information-theoretic network security are increasingly manifest in electronic commerce, reliable communications, and confidentiality of legal, proprietary, diplomatic, and medical information.

Abstract: Cyberattacks are enabled by software vulnerabilities that allow attackers to plant software exploits. As old vulnerabilities are found and fixed, attackers continue to find new ones. As a result, software vendors, system administrators and security professionals have come to rely increasingly on techniques that insert additional code into software for detecting and/or blocking cyber attacks in progress. This process, called software instrumentation, can be applied to the broadest range of software if it operates on binary format in which most software is distributed, rather than on source code. Moreover, binary based techniques are more general: unlike source-codebased techniques, they are not limited to a particular programming language.<br/><br/>One of the major challenges in binary instrumentation is the complexity of modern instruction sets. Accurate instrumentation requires the semantics of all instructions to be captured, since all of the analyses and transformations performed by the instrumentor are based on this semantics. Clearly, this is a daunting task even for a single architecture: the Intel manual describing the x86 instruction set runs to over 1500 pages describing over 1100 instructions. When this task is multiplied across different architectures such as ARM, PowerPC, SPARC, MIPS, etc, the effort involved becomes impractically large. This project will develop a novel approach that avoids the need for modeling instruction sets by leveraging knowledge embedded in retargetable code generators in today's compilers such as GCC. This approach not only simplifies the development of instrumentation, but also makes it applicable to all architectures for which a code generator is available. Using this approach, this project will develop a platform to support efficient, architecture-neutral static instrumentation of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) binaries. Based on this platform, this project will develop several effective instrumentations for hardening software against common vulnerabilities.

Abstract: With the advent of sensor-rich mobile devices such as smartphones, an increasing number of people are sharing personal "contextual" information like location, activity, and health/fitness information with members of their social network. To enhance privacy for people sharing such information, a large body of research has focused on ways for users to specify who should be authorized to access their information. This research improves end-user privacy by addressing the related question of "Who is accessing my information and to what extent?". Providing users with an accurate sense of their "exposure" will enable them to better control how their contextual information is shared and will help mitigate emerging privacy risks.<br/><br/>This research advances the state of the art in privacy by formalizing the notion of exposure-awareness research, and by investigating metrics that can be used to quantify a person?s exposure, developing usable feedback models and visualizations that leverage these metrics to convey exposure, and creating exposure control extensions to established policy architectures to help users control exposure and refine their data sharing policies over time. The proposed research will thus allow ordinary people to proactively rein in the amount of personal information shared online, and will reduce the privacy risks for the large population of users who are increasingly using social-networking applications to share personal contextual information.

Since 2001, CCS started accommodating affiliated workshops to explore security issues in a variety of emerging areas. The CCS workshops have become active forums for researchers to form focus groups, discuss and collaborate on emerging and critical security problems, and disseminate fresh, revolutionary (and sometimes even controversial) ideas. These workshops also serve as natural venues to bring together researchers from multiple disciplines to address security issues in specific domains, such as health care, cloud computing and national critical infrastructures. The workshop selection process is rigorous and well coordinated. All workshop proposals are carefully reviewed by the CCS steering committee and evaluated based on their topic, intellectual merits, and relevance to academia and industry.

Abstract: The past decade has seen a growing reliance on data driven technologies, including recommendation systems, targeted advertising, and search personalization. This growth in big data has made data privacy into a central concern. The central question raised is: how can we continue to extract useful information from large datasets, while provably protecting some measure of privacy for the individuals contained in these datasets?<br/><br/>This research centers around advancing the state of the art in privacy preserving data analysis. It specifically has several themes: (1) Exploiting structure in the private data being analyzed, as well as the classes of queries used in the analysis to give computationally efficient algorithms for private data analysis. (2) Deepening the connections between private data analysis and machine learning theory. (3) Relaxing the adversarial collusion model implicit in most work on the foundations of data privacy, and (4) applying the tools of differential privacy to usefully exploit and analyze noise in other algorithmic settings. To ensure the broad impact of this research, this project includes substantial outreach activities, including workshop organization, course development, and the development of a textbook and other educational materials.

Abstract: The project aims at quantifying a general network's inner potential<br/>for supporting various forms of security by achieving secret common<br/>randomness between pairs or groups of its nodes. Statistical and<br/>computational secrecy measures are being considered against a general<br/>passive adversary. Common-randomness-achieving protocols are classified<br/>into two groups: culture-building and crowd-shielding. The former achieves<br/>common randomness between nodes situated in close proximity of each other,<br/>from correlated observations of specific (natural or induced) network<br/>phenomena. The latter ties together the security of multiple communication<br/>links, to the point where an adversary can no longer isolate and attack<br/>a single link without attacking the group as a whole. The broad range of<br/>investigated protocols cover multiple topics, from multipath diversity<br/>to network tomography, from secure network coding to protocol coding,<br/>and from anonymous routing to the spread of epidemics. The protocols<br/>harvest network randomness from diverse sources like ciphertext blocks<br/>originating at various terminals, contention protocols (delay randomness)<br/>or network topology (in highly-dynamic, or ad-hoc networks).<br/><br/>Communication networks are naturally dynamic, inherently redundant,<br/>and largely unpredictable. While the former two features have long<br/>been recognized as a valuable resource for integrity, efficiency<br/>and confidentiality, network unpredictability is often regarded as an<br/>incommodity. This project shows how network randomness can be harvested,<br/>and, together with diversity, exploited to enhance communication<br/>security. In doing so, it develops a more profound understanding about<br/>the statistical nature of networks, which can be applied to a broad range<br/>of information-assurance objectives. The technical approaches and the<br/>general philosophy developed in this project, and disseminated through<br/>conferences and seminars, have the potential to inspire an abundance of<br/>related research. The project will directly impact dozens of students<br/>through Senior Design projects, a research-and-open-project approach to<br/>curriculum development, and three new graduate courses containing related<br/>topics. The PIs are actively involved in programs aimed at increasing<br/>the involvement of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with<br/>disabilities in engineering and computing sciences.

Abstract: This research project helps secure the privacy of web browser users. It specifically targets the browser addon framework, which allows third-party developers to extend the browser's functionality. These addons are written in JavaScript and have extraordinary privileges and access to sensitive user information. Therefore, vetting third-party addons to prevent malicious or accidental security violations is critical. However, the current vetting process for browser addons is manual and ad-hoc, making this process both tedious and error-prone. The goal of this research project is to enhance and automate addon vetting by using static analysis for JavaScript to enforce formal security policies.<br/><br/>The approach taken by this project is three-fold: (1) design formal security policies to provide provable guarantees; (2) create a provably-sound static security analysis for JavaScript-based browser addons; and (3) develop new tools for explaining security problems in addon code so that third-party developers can revise insecure add ons to eliminate vulnerabilities. This work benefits society as a whole by giving people assurance that their sensitive information is being treated securely. The work also benefits academia and industry by providing the first-ever provably-sound JavaScript static analysis for browser addons. The techniques that are developed will advance understanding of how to usefully analyze dynamic languages such as JavaScript, and the analysis framework itself will enhance research infrastructure by providing a platform for researchers to develop static analyses for JavaScript.

Abstract: Malicious software (malware) has become a major threat to computer security and will continue to be a central theme for computer security research for decades. This project takes a binary and virtualization centric approach to effectively and efficiently defeat malware using both online and offline analysis. Offline malware analysis aims to extract knowledge about the inner-workings for a newly discovered malware instance or software exploit, for the purpose of building up proper defense against similar attacks. Online malware defense aims to build efficient security mechanisms to effectively confine malicious behavior and collect enough evidence for subsequent security investigation.<br/><br/>For offline malware analysis, a novel virtualization-based malware analysis platform is used, on top of which new type inference techniques are applied to malware decomposition and vulnerability diagnosis. For online malware defense, new techniques for module-level sandbox and execution replay using virtualization are cooperatively used to defeat malware.<br/><br/>The results from this research will be disseminated through both peer-reviewed publications and software release. Based on this research, new course materials, modular hands-on projects, and professional training tutorials will be developed, to help future computer engineers and security researchers gain in-depth knowledge about malware defense.

Abstract: Abstract:<br/>Providing cyber security against attackers who penetrate the network, insider attackers, and non-malicious user errors or equipment failures is a formidable challenge for the scientific community. The investigator addresses problems in the area of network forensics that arise in packet-based communication of information. A key feature of the research approach is the use of timing as an under-utilized degree of freedom that provides rich statistical structure about the information dynamics. Using timing modality for performing network forensics has the advantage that it will not excessively perturb normal operation in packet networks where the information exchange is achieved via packet contents. A novelty of this research is the inclusion of causal inference. Human judgments about the likelihood of events and dependencies among variables is strongly influenced by the perception of cause-effect relationships. To extend the same decision making power, a man-made system must acquire the ability to process cause-effect relationships, rather than only assessing questions of statistical dependence. PI's objective is to understand causal influences between network flows using the timing modality. <br/>The PI will embark on an ambitious multidisciplinary research program that targets both theoretical and practical fundamental problems in security. The main research endeavors undertaken by the PI are: (1) analysis and mitigation of queuing timing side channels that arise in presence of shared resources; (2) develop of causal inference metrics and algorithms for complex networks; (3) design of efficient compression and storage approaches for network flows using good compression codes for point processes; (4) design of network flow watermarks that will be inserted in packet timings and serve the dual purpose of providing data integrity as well as a means for network inference.

Abstract: Malicious software (a.k.a. malware) is at the basis of most cyber-criminal operations, causing significant financial loss and posing great risks to national security.<br/><br/>This research creates novel network-centric behavior-based malware detection systems that automatically learn how to identify malware-compromised machines within a network, and that can self-tune to achieve the best possible trade-off between malware detection rate and false alarms for a given network. This self-tuning property is achieved by combining models of malware-generated network traffic with models of legitimate user-generated network activities to build hybrid detection models that can adapt to a specific network environment and accurately detect malware-generated network traffic crossing the network perimeter.<br/><br/>This new approach to malware detection takes into account events that occur within an entire network, rather than focusing on events that occur at each single host, and focuses on adaptive detection of all types of malware, rather than being limited to a specific malware type (e.g., botnets). Therefore, the detection systems resulting from this research will provide new effective detection capabilities that can complement current anti-malware technologies and significantly contribute to a better defense-in-depth strategy against malware.

Abstract: Over 80 million households in the United States have a home computer and an Internet connection. The vast majority of these are overseen by people who have little computer security knowledge or training, and many users try to avoid making security decisions because they feel they don't have the knowledge and skills to maintain proper security. Nevertheless, home computer users still make security-related decisions on a regular basis --- for example, whether or not to click on a link in an email message --- without being aware that is what they are doing. Their decisions are guided by how they think about computer security,their mental models. Interestingly, these models do not have to be technically correct to lead to desirable security behaviors. In other words, sometimes even "wrong" mental models produce good security decisions. This project will explore the implications of that insight. By eliminating the constraint that non-technical users must become more like computer security experts to properly protect themselves, this project will identify and create more effective ways of helping home computer users make good security decisions.<br/><br/>This project will help advance our understanding of how mental models of security are formed and how ideas are incorporated into mental models and transmitted from person to person. What kinds of information are incorporated into home computer users' mental models? Work will initially be focused on experimentally testing two hypotheses: a) stories about experiences have a larger influence on behavior than behavioral advice, and b) information from friends and colleagues has a stronger influence on mental models, and therefore behavior, than information from security experts. Additionally, the prevalence of particular mental models will be measured and correlated with actual user security behaviors. Through these investigations, this project will characterize the reasons that many home computer users choose not to act securely --- a question which is one of the biggest challenges of home computer security. Finally, this project will explore ways of encouraging behaviors that support secure system use by developing a prototype socio-technical system that is capable of influencing their mental models and moving people toward models that lead to greater security.<br/><br/>Home computer security and personal information security are large problems today. Current education campaigns have failed to effect widespread changes in the security behaviors of non-technical users. New technologies are being developed, but will do nothing if users intentionally choose to ignore the technology or to work around it. This project will find better ways of informing people about security issues, altering their understanding of security threats and thereby their security behaviors, which will ultimately create more secure home computers. It will produce research tools, including survey instruments and security behavior measurement software that can be used by other security researchers. It will train a number of students, both graduate and undergraduate, in working on multi-disciplinary, distributed teams. The results from this study will be disseminated broadly to multiple academic communities.

Abstract: The ability to communicate and readily access information helps make possible positive social and political change. The Internet's effects on developing nations' educational, economic, and governmental institutions have been well explored by social scientists and technical experts. However, in unfortunately many instances, undemocratic governments monitor and censor Internet communication to attempt to control their populations. Although there are a number of existing technologies that support private communication in the presence of a restricted adversary who controls only a fraction of the network and has limited resources, we currently lack solutions that enable anonymous communication when the network is fully controlled by a nation-state adversary.<br/><br/>This research develops methods of providing unfiltered, anonymous, and high performance Internet access, even in the presence of strong nation-state adversaries. The project (i) investigates methods of improving connectivity in heavily regulated networks using novel hidden channels, (ii) improves the resilience of anonymity networks to denial-of-service attacks, (iii) introduces techniques for detecting suspicious behavior in anonymity networks, and (iv) enables high performance anonymous messaging through the development of novel anonymity protocols and algorithms.<br/><br/>The project's themes of privacy and security have been integrated into security courses developed for Georgetown's newly established Ph.D. program. More broadly, the project benefits society by improving the ability to privately access information, even in networks controlled by oppressive governments. The project will increase the participation of groups whose ability to communicate is currently muted, and will provide unfettered Internet access to regions in which free communication would otherwise be unavailable.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of techniques for secure computation on protected data offers a major incentive for development of tools for general-purpose secure computation that protects data privacy, as opposed to computation of specialized tasks. The recent emergence of cloud computing and the need to protect privacy of sensitive data used in outsourced computation serves as another major motivation for this work. With this in mind, this project targets at developing a compiler suitable for privacy-preserving execution of any functionality specified by a user program. Our compiler transforms a program written in an extension of the C programming language, where data to be protected are marked as private, into its secure distributed implementation in C, which can be consecutively compiled into a binary executable by a native compiler. The goal of the project is to preserve all features of the programming language and enable efficient implementation of user programs using a number of optimization techniques. The secure distributed computation is implemented using secure multi-party techniques on secret-shared data and is suitable for secure collaborative computation and secure computation outsourcing.<br/><br/>These techniques will allow for more secure cloud computing, even in the presence of attackers. Other broader impacts include outreach to female middle school girls to increase interest in computer science, a summer school program for graduate students on secure computation in the cloud, and involving students from a nearby predominantly African-American university in the research program.

Abstract: In today's information-driven economy, organizations are finding it increasingly difficult to control the flow of sensitive information. <br/>This project is building a system called PDC (for Practical Data Confinement), a novel information security architecture built around coarse-grained isolation, fine-grained dynamic information flow tracking (DIFT), and informed policy enforcement. In broad terms, PDC provides mechanisms for tracking the movement of confidential data and enforcing dissemination restrictions that specify how, when, and to whom the data may be externalized. PDC requires no changes to applications or the operating system, and is thus readily deployable in existing IT environments. PDC makes use of an augmented hypervisor that enforces inter-VM isolation and carefully tracks the movement of sensitive data between the virtual CPU registers, memory, and disk within each VM. The hypervisor also intercepts all externally observable output actions (e.g., network communication, writing data to a mobile storage medium, sending data to a printer) and enforces security policies, allowing or denying specific application requests to externalize sensitive data. The main focus of the current work is to overcome the performance barriers that have hindered similar approaches in the past.

Abstract: This project studies Internet censorship using novel measurement techniques, ranging from low-level packet filtering on Internet Protocol (IP) networks to high-level censorship of social media content. Collectively these techniques can provide greater situational awareness of censorship dynamics. <br/><br/>The project focuses on a suite of advanced inference techniques for when ?direct observation? is unavailable or impractical such as, for example, methods for detecting IP tunnels based on per-hop Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) inference techniques in order to reason about the physical characteristics of a given IP network and, for example, measurement on social media postings of redactions and the speed of redactions. <br/><br/>This research has broad implications on studies of methods to provide awareness of restrictive control of information and content on networks, which would be of interest to software developers, system administrators, and policy makers alike.

Abstract: Sensor networks enable real-time gathering of large amounts of data that can be mined and analyzed for taking critical actions. As such, sensor networks are a key component of decision-making infrastructures. A critical issue in this context is the trustworthiness of the data being collected. Data integrity and quality decide the trustworthiness of data. Data integrity can be undermined not only because of errors by users, measurement devices and applications, but also because of malicious subjects who may inject inaccurate data with the goal of deceiving the data users. A fundamental tradeoff exists between data quality and the cost to gather and protect this data, e.g., in terms of sensor node energy. This project focuses on a multi-faceted solution to the problem of assessing integrity of data streams in sensor networks, taking into account cost and energy constraints. Key elements of the solution are: (a) a cyclic framework supporting the assessment of sensor data trustworthiness based on provenance, and sensor trustworthiness based on data that sensors provide; (b) strategies for continuously updating trust scores of sensor data and nodes; (c) a game-theoretic model to analyze and mitigate the risks due to active adversaries that try to undermine data integrity; (d) protocols for sensor network sleep/wake scheduling and routing that balance the data quality and energy efficiency tradeoff. The project also includes the development of tools for assessing data trustworthiness, and experimental evaluation of the system performance. The research has impact on healthcare, homeland security, and applications in several other domains.

Abstract: This project develops the foundations for automating verification of secure and trustworthy systems. It extends the range of analyses that are amenable to automated checking and addresses scalability. Symbolic techniques that represent possibly infinite sets of states by symbolic constraints have become important tools, but many systems of interest fall outside the scope of current techniques. There is a real need to extend and combine the power of symbolic analysis techniques to cover a much wider class of systems in order to develop the foundations for security and trustworthy software and systems.<br/><br/>Maude is a language based on rewriting logic. Maude can be used to model a system of any kind -- for example, an algorithm, a database, a hardware system, a programming language, a network protocol, a sensor network, or the molecular biology dynamics of a cell -- using a set of rewrite rules that describe the systems behavior. The current Maude implementation provides a high performance rewrite engine, as well as built-in search, unification, and model checking tools to support execution and analysis of systems specified in Maude. This project will develop general extensibility techniques for symbolic analysis that can simultaneously combine the power of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) constraint solving, rewriting- and unification-based analysis, and automata-based model checking to analyze a wide variety of systems beyond the scope of each separate technique. Specifically, the goals of the project are to: (i) develop the semantic foundations of extensible symbolic analysis combining SMT solving, rewriting and narrowing, and automata-based model checking; (ii) endow the Maude formal specification system with combined symbolic analysis capabilities based on such foundations; and (iii) demonstrate through case studies the power of such combined and extensible symbolic techniques in analyzing challenging systems in areas such as: model checking, theorem proving, programming languages, cryptographic protocols, and real-time and cyber-physical systems. <br/><br/>Maude has a substantial set of users who are doing research on approaches to secure and trustworthy systems. These users are poised to use the new techniques and tools as they develop.

Abstract: This project develops the foundations for automating verification of secure and trustworthy systems. It extends the range of analyses that are amenable to automated checking and addresses scalability. Symbolic techniques that represent possibly infinite sets of states by symbolic constraints have become important tools, but many systems of interest fall outside the scope of current techniques. There is a real need to extend and combine the power of symbolic analysis techniques to cover a much wider class of systems in order to develop the foundations for security and trustworthy software and systems.<br/><br/>Maude is a language based on rewriting logic. Maude can be used to model a system of any kind -- for example, an algorithm, a database, a hardware system, a programming language, a network protocol, a sensor network, or the molecular biology dynamics of a cell -- using a set of rewrite rules that describe the systems behavior. The current Maude implementation provides a high performance rewrite engine, as well as built-in search, unification, and model checking tools to support execution and analysis of systems specified in Maude. This project will develop general extensibility techniques for symbolic analysis that can simultaneously combine the power of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) constraint solving, rewriting- and unification-based analysis, and automata-based model checking to analyze a wide variety of systems beyond the scope of each separate technique. Specifically, the goals of the project are to: (i) develop the semantic foundations of extensible symbolic analysis combining SMT solving, rewriting and narrowing, and automata-based model checking; (ii) endow the Maude formal specification system with combined symbolic analysis capabilities based on such foundations; and (iii) demonstrate through case studies the power of such combined and extensible symbolic techniques in analyzing challenging systems in areas such as: model checking, theorem proving, programming languages, cryptographic protocols, and real-time and cyber-physical systems. <br/><br/>Maude has a substantial set of users who are doing research on approaches to secure and trustworthy systems. These users are poised to use the new techniques and tools as they develop. For critical systems, where even small security issues can lead to catastrophic failures, this foundational research will support rigorous techniques and tools for automated and scalable checking.

Abstract: Our society is in the midst of a great revolution due to Big Data. This revolution affects every aspect of our lives from online to offline, from business to science. Privacy today is both a major social concern and an intellectually challenging problem; the problem is exacerbated by the Big Data trend. Differential privacy is a principled approach to achieving the goal of privacy which, conceived as it was in the context of large databases, is especially suited for Big Data. This workshop will bring together researchers on differential privacy with the world's leading Big Data theoreticians to congregate at the Simons Institute in the Fall of 2013 to create a rare opportunity for true breakthroughs both in Privacy and in Big Data.<br/><br/>The Simons Institute will be hosting a special semester on "Theoretical foundations of Big Data analysis" during Fall of 2013, which will bring together several experts in analysis of big data. The purpose of the workshop will be on the one hand to develop new differential-privacy-inspired techniques for allowing large-scale data analysis without threatening the privacy of individuals, and on the other hand for the two communities to explore together the statistical concepts and techniques which are at the basis of both. The four-day workshop on "Big Data and Differential Privacy" will take place December 11-14, 2013 at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, located in Berkeley, CA.

Abstract: Phishing is a scam by which an e-mail user is duped into revealing personal or confidential information that the scammer can use illicitly. This research explores the design features presented in phishing attacks, investigates how individual knowledge and psychological involvement influences people's abilities in phishing detection across levels of deceptiveness, and evaluates the effects of phishing related education and phishing detection technologies in mitigating individuals' phishing susceptibility. The experiments involve students, real world consumers, and employees in an organization to compare the effectiveness of email authentication toolbars and client software (either by themselves or in conjunction with phishing related educational interventions) on mitigating individual susceptibility to phishing attacks. The purpose of the project is to explore the features of phishing e-mails and evaluate the mechanism of its effects by using a variety of research methodologies such as content analysis, telephone surveys, and quasi-experiments. <br/><br/>Phishing is a phenomenon of internet fraud that not only directly causes millions of dollars in loss, but also erodes consumers' trust in online communication and transactions. The erosion drives consumers away from online businesses. Fighting the threat of phishing is an urgent task and calls for research from multiple perspectives. The research deepens our understanding of phishing as a social phenomenon that takes advantages of human vulnerabilities. The research team disseminates the findings to the general public, industry organizations, the research community, and law enforcement organizations. The channels include workshops on internet crimes and information security and also the local InfaGuard program in collaboration with a regional FBI office.

Abstract: Blockciphers are the basic building block of shared-key cryptography. However, for certain important cryptographic goals, like building encryption schemes, the interface presented by blockciphers is limiting. A more modern primitive, the tweakable blockcipher (TBC), is often a better fit. Like a blockcipher, a TBC takes as input a secret key, a block of data and the tweak which is an additional input which provides variability to the TBC's input-output behavior without having to change the secret key. TBC-based cryptography has the potential to deliver efficient constructions with better security than analogous blockcipher-based designs, as well natural support for associated data inputs, key reuse, and other practical considerations.<br/><br/>Despite its clear promise, TBC-based cryptography has not received a sustained and coherent examination. This project provides such an examination, in an effort to better understand the potential of TBCs to impact future cryptographic practice. It explores the construction of TBCs, both from scratch and leveraging off-the-shelf primitives. It reconsiders existing blockcipher-based constructions starting from the question, "what happens if we replace the blockcipher with a TBC?", and leading to new designs with increased security, and greater resilience to certain implementation and usage mistakes. It also considers foundational matters concerning definitions of security for TBCs, and connections to idealized models of ciphers.

Abstract: A significant amount of sensitive data communicated over wireless media makes wireless communication security an issue of paramount importance. The standard implemented solution to security over wireless networks is based on a modular approach in which transmission and encryption are carried out separately. State-of-the-art encryption algorithms are thus agnostic to the characteristics of the underlying network, but this separation approach is increasingly hard to justify as fast and reliable communications over wireless networks require more effective security architectures.<br/><br/>Several theoretical insights have been obtained from information theory in the past few years that suggest that fundamentally secure transmission in wireless interference networks is possible by jointly designing for reliability and security at the outset. This project takes a distinctive approach to accelerate the deployment of information-theoretically secure design of wireless networks by analyzing models with realistic assumptions, developing practical coding schemes and validating with a wireless test-bed. The project investigates two intertwined research tasks: (i) overcoming modeling assumptions, by providing security guarantees irrespective of adversaries' channels, modeling and countering adversaries that can manipulate channel conditions to their advantage, and removing idealized assumptions in implementation; (ii) providing explicit channel code designs that ensure strong secrecy and developing secure codes for multi-terminal wireless networks.<br/><br/>Additional activities related to the project include : (i) outreach to the computational security community towards integration of information-theoretic and computational security principles; (ii) dissemination of research results in various forms; (iii) a research exchange program between Georgia Tech and Penn State; (iv) a jointly taught graduate level course by the PIs that incorporates the research results of this project; and (v) recruitment of and mentorship for women in engineering and science. The research conducted in this project will facilitate the implementation of information-theoretic security principles on wireless systems and lead to novel cost-effective security techniques at the physical-layer.

Abstract: The goal of this project is to provide secure and robust communications in underwater sensor networks (UWSNs). Specifically, the project is investigating denial of service attacks and their countermeasures in such networks.<br/><br/>There has been a growing interest in developing underwater acoustic sensor networks in recent years, aiming for breakthroughs in aquatic environment monitoring for scientific exploration, commercial exploitation and coastline protection. The unique properties of underwater environments result in two major differences between UWSNs and land-based sensor networks: the communication method and sensor node mobility. Because radio frequency (RF) signals attenuate quickly in water, communications in UWSNs normally use acoustic channels, which feature long latencies, low bandwidth, high error rates, and high energy consumption. The mobility of sensor nodes leads to dynamic network topology.<br/><br/>Since underwater sensor nodes are deployed in the field and communicate through acoustic channels that can be accessed easily by adversaries, they are vulnerable to various attacks. This project investigates denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and countermeasures in underwater networks. <br/><br/>The project has three research thrusts.<br/><br/>1. DoS attacks and countermeasures at the physical and link layers. <br/><br/>2. DoS attacks and countermeasures at the network layer. <br/><br/>3. System integration and field testings. The outcomes of the project, including both attacks and countermeasures, will be thoroughly evaluated in simulation, lake, and ocean testbeds.<br/><br/>This project will lead to more robust communications in underwater networks, and thus advance the development and use of such networks. <br/><br/>Beyond the research significance, this project impacts education on three fronts. First, it will support graduate students in their advanced research in the fields of security, communication, networking, and computer engineering. Second, it will motivate undergraduates, especially women and other under-represented groups, to participate in advanced research in computing and engineering. Third, this project will promote multi-disciplinary collaboration.

Abstract: Most cryptographic applications crucially rely on secret keys that are chosen randomly and are unknown to an attacker. Unfortunately, the process of deriving secret keys in practice is often difficult, error-prone and riddled with security vulnerabilities. Badly generated keys offer a prevalent source of attacks that render complex cryptographic applications completely insecure, despite their sophisticated design and rigorous mathematical analysis. Even though key derivation plays a central role in the security landscape, it has received surprisingly little formal study within the cryptographic community, leading to a large disconnect between the theory and practice.<br/><br/>In this project, several important scenarios for key derivation are examined for their capability to improve security with provable guarantees, including the use of random number generators (RNGs), passwords, and biometrics. In particular:<br/><br/>- How RNGs are designed to properly combine the entropy gathering, randomness extraction and pseudorandom generation modules, while achieving the best possible subset of clearly defined security properties against a variety of adversarial scenarios.<br/><br/>- How to reduce the effectiveness of ?offline dictionary attacks? when generating keys from passwords.<br/><br/>- How biometrics can be safely reused to generate many secret keys across many applications raises several interesting questions, combining cryptographic security properties with those of error-correcting codes.

The investigators study (1) ex-ante spectrum rule enforcement mechanisms (i.e., preventive) such as spectrum access control via policy reasoners, (2) ex-post spectrum rule enforcement schemes (i.e., punitive) with policy conformance monitoring that employ cryptographic commitments, (3) ex-post enforcement schemes that can uniquely identify rogue transmitters, and (4) the economic viability of spectrum sharing with different enforcement schemes.<br/><br/>The project provides a broad range of education and industry outreach activities in order to rapidly insert research advances into curriculum and university-industry partnerships. Specifically, the investigators will present short courses and tutorials at the annual Virginia Tech Wireless Symposium and Summer School, and widely disseminate findings through NSF Industry & University Collaborative Research Centers (I/UCRC) at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

Abstract: Computers and people live in a world governed by policy. At the lowest level, policies determine how information flows within networks; at the highest level, they describe how users' personal information is shared across applications. Of course, end-users, as policy authors, make mistakes: rules can have unintended consequences and multiple policies can interact in ways that their authors didn't intend. Users can benefit from tools to help them understand the policies they write and maintain. Policy analysis refers to rigorous methods for detecting these situations before they cause harm. Given the personal and sensitive information migrating to cloud-based applications, analyzers for mainstream policy contexts have clear impact on computing infrastructure.<br/><br/>Prior research has shown that first-order logic is a suitable foundation for capturing and analyzing many application- and network-based policies. In particular, analyses based on scenario-finding provide concrete and detailed feedback for policy authors. This project focuses on techniques to make scenario-finding effective for real-world policies based on first-order logic. Specifically, the project pursues (1) foundational research on algorithms for model-finding in first-order logic, (2) methods to analyze federations of policies across multiple levels of abstraction (such as found in cloud computing), (3) handling additional policy features such as numeric constraints and dynamic network routing, and (4) methods to automatically generate repairs to policies against requirements or scenarios. The PIs' existing Margrave policy analyzer serves as a testbed and deployment vehicle for this research.

Abstract: This projects investigates the external and internal factors (e.g., demographic, personal, and psychological aspects) that impact senior citizens' online privacy behavior. The multi-perspective approach to address this question consists of surveys (standardized), intensive in-person interviews, focus groups, key stroke logging and log analysis and scenario based questionnaires to understand online privacy behavior and attitude. A computational framework for online privacy protection using Bayesian Networks will be developed that includes a privacy architecture incorporating security policies, enforceable measures and a set of recommendations for proper design of privacy-enhancing technologies. This research will also explore senior citizens' perceived value of their personal information and the impact of cyber security education on online privacy behavior.<br/><br/>Since there is limited empirical data and research about senior citizens and online privacy, this project has the potential to significantly contribute to the design of more usable and unbiased online privacy protection technology for elderly users of the Internet. Ultimately, the wider societal importance of the proposed research is that a deeper understanding of the interaction between personal, social and institutional factors in determining senior citizens' experience with online privacy is needed to facilitate the continuing effort in enhancing online privacy assurance on the Internet.

Abstract: Industrial control systems differ significantly from standard, general-purpose computing environments, and they face quite different security challenges. With physical "air gaps" now the exception, our critical infrastructure has become vulnerable to a broad range of potential attackers. In this project we develop novel network monitoring approaches that can detect sophisticated semantic attacks: malicious actions that drive a process into an unsafe state without however exhibiting any obvious protocol-level red flags. In one thrust, we conduct a measurement-centric study of ICS network activity, aimed at developing a deep understanding of operational semantics in terms of actors, workloads, dependencies, and state changes over time. In a second thrust, we develop domain-specific behavior models that abstract from low-level protocol activity to their semantic meaning according to the current state of the processes under control. Our goal is to integrate these models into operationally viable, real-time network monitoring that reports unexpected deviations as indicators of attacks or malfunction. A separate "Transition to Practice" phase advances our research results into deployment-ready technology by integrating it into the open-source Bro network monitor. Overall, our work will improve security and safety of today's critical infrastructure by providing effective, unobtrusive security monitoring tailored to their specific semantics. In addition, we tie a number of educational activities to the research and involve students at all levels.

Abstract: The availability of ideal randomness is a common assumption used not only in cryptography, but in many other areas of computer science, and engineering in general. Unfortunately, in many situations this assumption is highly unrealistic, and cryptographic systems have to be built based on imperfect sources of randomness. Motivated by these considerations, this project will investigate the validity of this assumption and consider several important scenarios where secure cryptographic systems must be built based on various kinds of imperfect randomness. <br/><br/>This project investigates the feasibility of cryptography with imperfect sources of randomness, and whether ideal randomness is necessary for building various cryptographic primitives. These techniques will be applied to the area of leakage-resilient cryptography. Namely, we consider a realistic attack scenario where the adversary can gain partial knowledge of some secret information. This project will design novel protocols which are resilient to such leakage of partial information.

Abstract: Side-channel attack (SCA) has shown to be a serious implementation attack to many cryptosystems. Practical countermeasures only mitigate the vulnerability to some extent. Considerable research efforts on leakage-resilient cryptography have so far not led to practical leakage-resilient implementations. One hindering reason is the lack of commonly accepted and sound metrics, standards, and evaluation procedures to measure and evaluate the vulnerability/resilience of cryptosystems to various side-channel attacks. Accurate modeling of side channels, however, is one of the open problems in applied crypto research. This project aims to close the gap between SCA theories and practices by formalizing a general framework for side-channel attack analysis and security evaluation of cryptosystems. <br/><br/>The proposed framework quantifies the effect of algorithmic and implementation characteristics on the success rate of the theoretically strongest maximum likelihood attack, revealing system-inherent SCA-related parameters for security improvement. The framework will extract maximum leakage from the observed measurement data in the black-box scenario, often the realistic situation for adversaries. State-of-the-art statistical methods are employed in the framework to precisely analyze and evaluate the overall side-channel leakage. This holistic framework will significantly alleviate the burden of security system architects, software developers, and hardware designers in their quest to build SCA security into systems they design, so as to ultimately yield provably secure hardware.

Abstract: Cloud computing allows users to delegate data and computation to cloud providers, at the cost of giving up physical control of their computing infrastructure. An attacker with physical access to the computing platform can perform various physical attacks, referred to as digital insertion and observation attacks, which include probing memory buses, tampering with memory, and cold-boot style attacks. While memory encryption can prevent direct leakage of data under digital observation, memory access patterns to even encrypted data may leak sensitive information. This work will allow organizations to securely outsource their computing infrastructure to an untrusted cloud provider, while preserving a similar level of security as if hosting the infrastructure in house<br/><br/>This project will develop DIORE (Digital Insertion and Observation Resistant Execution) which is a combined hardware software platform immune to digital insertion and observation attacks. DIORE provides memory-trace oblivious execution, relying on efficient hardware implementations of Oblivious RAM, and novel compiler techniques for partitioning programs such that Oblivious RAM accesses are minimized. This ensures that an adversary with access to a program execution's memory trace learns nothing about the code or data other than what is revealed intentionally. DIORE opens up possibilities for new cloud applications involving sensitive information such as genomic, medical, or financial data -- domains that are considered too privacy sensitive for today's cloud.

Abstract: On Election Day, poll workers must operate a complex system composed of people, processes, and technology. Even minor mistakes in the operation of the system can lead to security failures, which could in turn lead to the wrong candidates being selected. However, pollworkers are generally not technically astute, receive minimal training, are not attuned to systems and security issues, and are prone to making security mistakes that endanger elections, especially towards the end of the day due to worker fatigue.<br/><br/>This project studies how poll workers manage voting technology at the opening and closing of polls on Election Day in an effort to understand the impact poll workers have on voting system security. In particular, it will examine what kinds of common security problems do poll workers encounter in opening/closing the polls; why do these problems seem to occur and their likely causes; and if there are particular points in poll/opening/closing where poll workers are more likely to encounter security issues or make mistakes.<br/><br/>The project reveals opportunities for deeper investigation of security gaps in poll workers? setting up and shutting down the polls that may be remedied by better design of procedures, job aids, training and content available in the polling place.

Abstract: CAREER: A Networking Approach to Host-based Intrusion Detection<br/>Proposal# 0844144<br/>Raheem A. Beyah<br/>Georgia State University<br/><br/>Award Abstract<br/>Day by day, threats to the cyber infrastructure are becoming more complex and, in response, so too are defense mechanisms. One approach to securing nodes is to place a defense mechanism (e.g., intrusion detection system) on the node. This brings many challenges, with the most significant being that potential vulnerabilities in the defense mechanism can provide an additional avenue through which the host can be compromised. To address these challenges, this research investigates completely decoupling the defense mechanisms from the host, while continuing to provide insight about malicious activity as if the defense mechanisms resided on the host. This requires the development of new algorithms and the application of various techniques (e.g., statistical, machine learning, signal processing) to extract from a node?s network traffic characteristics that enable the inference of the state of its hardware components. Over the course of this project, a combination of experimentation and simulation will lead to the development of empirical and analytic models. The models will be used to develop network-based defense systems that provide capabilities similar to those provided by mechanisms traditionally considered host-based. This work leverages the concept of information leakage to bridge the computer architecture, computer networking, and network security fields. This project also seeks to broaden participation of groups traditionally underrepresented in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Accordingly, through a summer academy, the PI is actively engaging underrepresented middle school students by using current technology to convey abstract computer architecture and computer networking concepts.

Abstract: Over 80 million households in the United States have a home computer and an Internet connection. The vast majority of these are overseen by people who have little computer security knowledge or training, and many users try to avoid making security decisions because they feel they don't have the knowledge and skills to maintain proper security. Nevertheless, home computer users still make security-related decisions on a regular basis --- for example, whether or not to click on a link in an email message --- without being aware that is what they are doing. Their decisions are guided by how they think about computer security,their mental models. Interestingly, these models do not have to be technically correct to lead to desirable security behaviors. In other words, sometimes even "wrong" mental models produce good security decisions. This project will explore the implications of that insight. By eliminating the constraint that non-technical users must become more like computer security experts to properly protect themselves, this project will identify and create more effective ways of helping home computer users make good security decisions.<br/><br/>This project will help advance our understanding of how mental models of security are formed and how ideas are incorporated into mental models and transmitted from person to person. What kinds of information are incorporated into home computer users' mental models? Work will initially be focused on experimentally testing two hypotheses: a) stories about experiences have a larger influence on behavior than behavioral advice, and b) information from friends and colleagues has a stronger influence on mental models, and therefore behavior, than information from security experts. Additionally, the prevalence of particular mental models will be measured and correlated with actual user security behaviors. Through these investigations, this project will characterize the reasons that many home computer users choose not to act securely --- a question which is one of the biggest challenges of home computer security. Finally, this project will explore ways of encouraging behaviors that support secure system use by developing a prototype socio-technical system that is capable of influencing their mental models and moving people toward models that lead to greater security.<br/><br/>Home computer security and personal information security are large problems today. Current education campaigns have failed to effect widespread changes in the security behaviors of non-technical users. New technologies are being developed, but will do nothing if users intentionally choose to ignore the technology or to work around it. This project will find better ways of informing people about security issues, altering their understanding of security threats and thereby their security behaviors, which will ultimately create more secure home computers. It will produce research tools, including survey instruments and security behavior measurement software that can be used by other security researchers. It will train a number of students, both graduate and undergraduate, in working on multi-disciplinary, distributed teams. The results from this study will be disseminated broadly to multiple academic communities.

Abstract: Electronic System Level ( ESL ) designs , specified behaviorally using<br/>high-level languages such as SystemC , raise the level of hardware<br/>design abstraction . This approach crucially depends on behavioral<br/>synthesis , which compiles ESL designs to Register Transfer Level ( RTL )<br/>designs . However , optimizations performed by synthesis tools make<br/>their implementation error-prone , undermining the trustworthiness of<br/>synthesized hardware . <br/><br/>This research develops a mechanized infrastructure for certifying<br/>hardware designs generated by behavioral synthesis . It entails<br/>developing a certified " reference flow " of synthesis transformations . <br/>The reference flow is disentangled from the workings of a production<br/>synthesis tool through new formal structure called " clocked control<br/>data flow graph " ( CCDFG ) formalizing internal design representation . <br/>Given an ESL design and its synthesized RTL , certification entails the<br/>following automatic steps : ( 1 ) extracting initial CCDFG ; ( 2 ) applying<br/>certified " primitive transformations " from the reference flow ,<br/>following the application sequence by the synthesis tool , and ( 3 )<br/>checking equivalence between the transformed CCDFG and RTL . Theorem<br/>proving is used to certify primitive transformations off-line ;<br/>equivalence checking accounts for low-level transformations and<br/>manual tweaks . The correspondence between the transformed CCDFG and<br/>the synthesized hardware makes equivalence checking efficient . <br/><br/>The project facilitates development of scalable and trustworthy<br/>hardware : adoption of ESL approach expedites design cycle while formal<br/>analysis guarantees trust in the synthesized hardware . The reference<br/>flow makes explicit key design invariants implicitly assumed by<br/>synthesis tools , facilitating development of more aggressive synthesis<br/>tools . Finally , the tight integration of two complementary techniques<br/>--- model checking and theorem proving --- in the certification is<br/>applicable to other domains .

Abstract: Computer performance has doubled many times over during the past 40 years, but the very techniques used to achieve these performance gains have made it increasingly difficult to build systems that are provably safe, secure, or reliable. This fact significantly impedes progress in the development of our most safety-critical embedded systems such as those found in medical, avionic, automotive, and military systems. A transformation in the way that these systems are created is needed, one that uses new hardware design techniques, computer architectures, and programming languages to create classes of hardware/software systems with formal and provable safety properties that are verifiable all the way down to the implementation level of bits and logic gates.<br/><br/>This research will change the way that hardware and embedded systems designers approach the problem of provable properties, enabling them to directly control and analyze the system at the lowest level and to statically determine if their designs are in compliance with a given policy. For example, if a system must be real-time this property can be verifiable for a full system, from gates to software, by ensuring that the architecture design carefully manages interference through a set of new hardware primitives, software designed to exploit these new primitives, specialized hardware analysis tools, and new design languages. To ensure this technology will have impact beyond academia the PIs are making these new technologies available and accessible through easy to use tools, continuing to include undergraduates at all levels of research to help train a new generation of engineers capable of designing safety-critical systems, and integrating concepts from information assurance into their extensive outreach activities. Over the long term this research will help create the skills and tools that embedded system engineers need to evaluate the trustworthiness of their systems, and it will ease the development of those critical systems on which we all depend on for our safety and livelihood.

Abstract: Maintaining the security of one's systems and devices in a way that ensures the right balance between functionality, security, and convenience remains complicated for most people. For example, people are routinely asked by their systems whether to accept a security certificate, install an application, heed security warnings, or reconfigure operating-system security settings. While these examples represent situations in which people regularly find themselves, people rarely have any basis to make an informed decision or to establish one conveniently. This research examines the concept of 'crowdsourced security' where the solution lies in people leveraging members of their community to secure their systems and devices.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this research is to determine the potential of crowdsourcing as a complementary strategy for enhancing security. An example challenge addressed in this research pertains to the security of one's personal data. Specifically the research seeks to develop security mechanisms that can exploit naturally occurring social relationships and utilize 'human computation' to shift the burden of security via authentication from machines to humans. Within this framework, the research investigates both questions about the technical effectiveness of crowdsourced security solutions, as well as socio-behavioral questions about users' preferences, motivations, and privacy concerns about such systems. This research will benefit society by producing a deeper understanding of how systems can be better secured through human participation and collaboration, moving beyond the status quo of current security mechanisms.

Abstract: The recent explosion in malware poses financial, privacy, and safety risks. This project explores a fundamentally new approach to malware detection that promises to be faster, more effective, and cheaper than current tools.<br/><br/>The evolution of malicious software, or malware, has seen increases in both malware's capabilities and sheer volume. Recent malware makes use of a number of sophisticated technologies including polymorphism, public key encryption, and peer-to-peer architectures. These advances are driven by significant resources put into malware development by both criminal enterprises and countries. Traditional malware detection tools rely on slow manual processes and the recent advances in malware have outrun the ability of existing tools to cope.<br/><br/>This project uses a new approach to the malware crisis that centers around constructive use of crowd-sourcing. The key insight is that the collection of machines on the Internet contains information that can be used to automatically classify software as either legitimate or malicious. This information includes not only the behavior of malware on individual machines but also the behavior of the aggregate population. For example, the aggregate statistics of how software propagates across the network can provide insight into whether the software is malicious.<br/><br/>A key component of the proposed work is binary translation-based dynamic signatures. Traditional malware detection tools have used static signatures, but polymorphic techniques have made this approach significantly more difficult. The project employs binary translation to efficiently collect dynamic traces for both code execution and behavioral events such as network communication and then generate signatures for these traces.<br/><br/>The project significantly reduces the threats of malware to society, especially since software developed through the project is freely available. The project is mentoring members of underrepresented minorities, and is infusing its ideas into the curriculum.

Abstract: Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) and other advances in hardware have made it possible to address many security issues, such as ensuring that all loaded software is from authorized sources. As an example, The Windows 8 Secure Boot relies on TPM technology to provide strong guarantees for device integrity, and both Intel and AMD chips include abilities to use external verifiers for code verification.<br/><br/>Although these hardware advances provide extremely useful and powerful security properties, researchers and practitioners have been slow to adopt these technologies. One of the main reasons is the lack of familiarity with the capabilities and properties of these technologies. To address this situation, the Trusted Infrastructure Workshop (TIW 2013) provides training for current graduate students with experience in computer security about these technologies and how they can be leveraged for research and engineering. TIW 2013 offers students lectures by leading researchers from industry, government, and academia that are actively developing and using trusted computing technologies, as well as developing future infrastructure technologies for building secure systems.

Abstract: The Team for Research in Ubiquitous Secure Technology (TRUST) REU Site integrates cyber security, privacy, and trustworthy systems with science and technology education to be intellectually, socially, and politically relevant and attractive to a diverse set of participants?in particular underrepresented minorities and women. The program project is a collaborative effort led by the TRUST Science & Technology Center that has six components: (1) an eight-week summer immersion research residency; (2) a series of symposia and advising workshops targeted at recruiting undergraduate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students interested in security and privacy; (3) a novel and innovative curriculum with learning activities coupled with social interaction and fun aspects of computer science and cyber security for two-year and four-year students; (4) cyber-enabled learning environments to connect participants and researchers; (5) industry seminars and field trips to highlight research trends and career opportunities in cyber security; and (6) post-session research conference participation.<br/><br/>Keeping information and computer systems secure is one of the country?s most formidable challenges. Daily headlines chronicle the fraud, viruses, privacy abuses, network outages, and security vulnerabilities across the spectrum of critical systems that support the nation?s financial, energy, healthcare, and transportation infrastructure. As such, technological research must consider security in a hierarchy of approaches that range from secure embedded systems to complex interdependent systems. However, creating secure, private, and trustworthy systems cannot be accomplished solely through technological means. To create secure, private, and trustworthy technology and systems requires an understanding of the relationship between the component parts and how one domain interacts with the other. Thus, there is an acute need for human resources who possess a deep understanding of the technical and non-technical foundations of STEM and trustworthy systems. In order to address this, the TRUST REU Site will blend cyberinfrastructure-enhanced discovery and learning opportunities with interdisciplinary research using the active-learning Peer-Led Team Learning approach to incorporate STEM, cyber security, and trustworthy systems science and technology concepts to create a research and education environment that will train the next generation of computer scientists and engineers who will develop new trustworthy systems.<br/><br/>Beyond the main goal of increasing the number of women and underrepresented minorities attaining baccalaureate degrees in STEM and continuing on to graduate education and technical careers, this program will have a broader impact on the cyber security and trustworthy systems community by becoming a model for collaborative secondary education partnerships that incorporate community college and undergraduate programs within a STEM educational framework. The program will emphasize four stages of the education pipeline (Recruitment, Transfer, Retention, and Advancement) and aim to capture students early enough in the pipeline that they will consider pursuing a major or career in STEM in general and cyber security in particular. The TRUST REU Site will also demonstrate how collaborative partnerships with operational strategies that support effective and engaging learning experience can inject resources designed to stimulate interest in STEM and cyber security among female and URM community college and four-year baccalaureate students and serve as a model for cyber security and trustworthy systems research and education projects at similar institutions in the future.

Abstract: In a world where everybody and everything is electronically connected, identity is essential to support trustworthy transactions. This project investigates novel techniques to design and implement on-chip fingerprints. Such fingerprints establish the hardware identity of an electronic system. The on-chip fingerprints are based on the existing, small and random manufacturing variations of electronic chips. Using a cross-disciplinary approach that combines recent advances in the field of statistics with those in circuit design, this project develops on-chip fingerprint structures that are optimized for stability, implementation cost, and security. Stable on-chip fingerprints are maximally sensitive to random manufacturing variations, and minimally sensitive to other environmental factors such as temperature, voltage, noise, and aging. Low-cost on-chip fingerprints are obtained by using statistical, architectural, and circuit-level techniques that maximize the amount of extracted entropy. Secure on-chip fingerprints are resistant against common attacks such as reverse engineering and model building. Thanks to its cross-disciplinary character, this project establishes a much-needed link between advanced statistical analysis and deep-submicron design for the purpose of circuit identification. This leads to better PUF designs, applicable across a wider range of applications: secure passports, anti-counterfeiting schemes, and security and trust at the endpoints. The project includes strong integration of research and education. For pre-college and entering freshman students, the project offers an introduction to trusted hardware, in the context of existing on-campus programs that involve minorities in engineering. For graduate students, the project offers a team-taught course, shared between the electrical engineering department and the statistics department.

Abstract: The need for accurate and unforgeable identity recognition techniques has become an issue of increasing urgency. Biometric approaches such as iris recognition hold huge promise but still have significant limitations, including susceptibility to 'spoofing'. This project seeks to advance our knowledge of security and accuracy of multibiometric systems by inventing, evaluating, and applying innovative methods and tools to combine highly accurate static traits, such as iris patterns, with novel traits based on the dynamics of eye movements. The strategy is to use existing iris recognition hardware to combine three different biometrics approaches related to the eye: measurement of iris patterns, unique characteristics of the eye globe and its muscles, and the brain's strategies for guiding visual attention. This multimodal ocular biometrics approach has the potential to improve liveness detection and resistance to sophisticated counterfeiting techniques and coercion attacks, while improving identification accuracy. This research tackles important questions related to the individuality, variability, scalability, and longevity of these ocular traits, building a foundation for security and accuracy improvement when those traits are combined with iris recognition. This project aims to benefit efforts such as the Unique Identification project in India, which seeks to use biometric information of 1.2 billion individuals to fight fraud.<br/><br/>Educational activities include three initiatives: 1) creation of a strong outreach activity to K-12 students, 2) expansion of an interdisciplinary research-oriented educational program previously created by the PI for undergraduate and graduate students, and 3) mentoring and guidance to interest undergraduate students in scientific careers and encourage more students from diverse backgrounds to pursue graduate study.

Abstract: Cryptographic hash functions are ubiquitous in modern cryptography.<br/>They are an integral part of digital signature and public-key<br/>encryption schemes, access control mechanisms, digital time-stamping<br/>routines, message authentication codes, and file synchronization<br/>utilities. They are implemented in point-of-sale terminals, ATM<br/>machines, operating systems, web browsers, routers, and mobile phones,<br/>to name just a few. Yet the design and analysis of hash functions has<br/>received relatively little attention from the cryptographic community,<br/>a shortcoming underscored by recent high-profile attacks on the<br/>often-used MD5 and SHA-1 hash functions.<br/><br/>This work aims to advance our understanding of cryptographic hash<br/>functions in theory and practice by developing three complementary<br/>themes. First, it further solidifies the formal foundations of<br/>hashing. This means establishing new and meaningful notions of what<br/>means for a hash function to be "good". Additionally it explores the<br/>powers and limitations of new analytic frameworks (for example,<br/>indifferentiability and human-ignorance), and search for a sharper<br/>view of design heuristics (in particular the random-oracle and<br/>ideal-cipher models.) Second, it investigates the design of "small"<br/>hash functions, called compression functions, with small domains and<br/>fixed ranges. Designs based on permutations, blockciphers and<br/>tweakable blockciphers are especially interesting. Third, it develops<br/>methods for transforming compression functions into "big" hash<br/>functions with flexible domains and ranges; traditionally, the range<br/>of a hash function is a string of a single fixed length. Also<br/>targetted is the problem of combining the outputs of multiple<br/>primitives for the purpose of security preservation in the presence of<br/>faults.

Abstract: The ubiquity of computing technology and the Internet have created an age of big data that has the potential to greatly enhance the efficiency of our societies and the well-being of all people. The trend comes with problems that threaten to prevent or undermine the benefits. An immediate concern is how to fuse, integrate and analyze data while respecting privacy, security and usage concerns. A second issue is allowing data to remain distributed, enabling its owners to maintain and control quality as well as to enforce security and privacy policies. A final underlying challenge is helping to produce sound and useful results by assuring that systems understand the meaning of the data being integrated and analyzing access and usage policies. For some domains, like health informatics and clinical research, solving these problems will have a significant impact on society.<br/><br/>This project explores an approach to solving these problems by developing a policy-compliant integration system for linked healthcare data. The system models data, schemas and policies using open Web standards such as Semantic Web languages, federates queries to independent Linked Data stores based on content, provides policy enforcement by modifying incompliant queries, and uses formal methods to guarantee correctness of key components.<br/><br/>This project provides new approaches to solving one of the most significant problems our society faces in the 21st century: benefiting from the integration of distributed linked data while respecting security, privacy, and usage requirements. The prototype tools and systems are incorporated into our educational activities and made available to others via appropriate open source licenses.

Abstract: Software bugs and vulnerabilities are primary causes for cyber-security breaches in today's society. Runtime monitoring, a technique to enforce safety and security properties at program execution time, is essential to detect intrusions and keep the system healthy. One of the main obstacles to adopt runtime monitoring techniques in practice is high performance overhead. Inlined security monitoring enforcement often delays and blocks the execution of protected programs. Conventional concurrent runtime monitors have not been able to leverage the multicore architectures for performance due to synchronization issues. If conventional synchronization primitives are used, when the monitor is crashed or blocked due to external events, the protected program will also be blocked even if the monitor is not monitoring. The goal of this proposal is to develop an innovative security monitoring technology, called Software Cruising, to explore multicore architectures for non-blocking concurrent security monitoring using lock-free data structures and algorithms. Software cruising eliminates the blocking effect and achieves efficient and scalable security monitoring. This can result in a game-changing capability in large-scale security monitoring for both cloud-based and traditional computing systems and applications.<br/><br/>The software cruising applications include, but are not limited to, heap buffer integrity checking, kernel memory cruising, data structure and object invariant checking, rootkit detection, and information provenance and flow checking. Three related sets of prototypical toolkits?Cruiser, Kruiser, and iCruiser?will be developed to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of large-scale software cruising. Cruiser is for lock-free heap buffer overflow monitoring of user-space programs. Kruiser is for kernel cruising on OS kernel heap buffer overflows and other security vulnerabilities. iCruiser is for user- and kernel-space data structure and object invariant cruising. The proposed research, upon completion, would make large-scale security monitoring more efficient and scalable in the increasingly popular multicore architecture and cloud environment, and thus significantly enhance system security. With the proposed tech transfer effort, applications as well as OS kernels will have better protection with the deployed software cruising technology. Broader impacts will also result from the education, outreach, and dissemination initiatives. Educational resources from this project, including course modules on software cruising and teaching laboratory designs, will be incorporated into online courses and disseminated through a dedicated web site. The project outcomes of this project will be disseminated broadly through publications, software releases, and technology transfer.

Abstract: Malware, especially botnets, have become the main source of most attacks and malicious activities on Internet. Bots communicate with each other and Command & Control servers to coordinate their malicious activities. This project is developing new techniques and tools to detect malicious activities and botnets through analyzing their communication channels. This project plans to investigate mechanisms for detecting these communication channels through several novel mechanisms: (i) through a graph analysis of social contacts, (ii) analyzing graph properties of communication to decipher Peer to peer communication properties of bots and (iii) machine learning based approaches to analyzing network traffic. The automation required to propagate malicious contents and malware will result in different behavior than human behavior in these communication channels. We expect the generated names, content, the time of contacts and communication, the social graph structures to be sufficiently different to enable us to develop techniques for detection of malicious entities. Our work focuses on developing robust techniques that are hard to evade or limit the botnet functions when they try to evade the detection mechanisms. Developed analysis tools will help in detecting botnets in networks and malicious entities in social networks. Educational impact will include training graduate and undergraduate students with valuable research skills while advancing the state of the art in network security and traffic analysis, contributing to the technology workforce. We will publish our results and enable technology transfer to industry.

Abstract: Machine learning on large-scale patient medical records can lead to the discovery of novel population-wide patterns enabling advances in genetics, disease mechanisms, drug discovery, healthcare policy, and public health. However, concerns over patient privacy prevent biomedical researchers from running their algorithms on large volumes of patient data, creating a barrier to important new discoveries through machine-learning. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to address this barrier by developing privacy-preserving tools to query, cluster, classify and analyze medical databases. In particular, the project aims to ensure differential privacy --- a formal mathematical notion of privacy designed by cryptographers which has gained considerable attention in the systems, algorithms, machine-learning and data-mining communities in recent years. The primary challenge in applying differentially-private machine learning tools to biomedical informatics is the lack of statistical efficiency, or the large number of samples required.<br/><br/>The project will overcome this challenge by drawing on insights obtained from the PI's expertise to develop differentially-private and highly statistically-efficient machine learning tools for classification and clustering. The proposed research will advance the state-of-the-art in privacy-preserving data analysis by combining insights from differential privacy, statistics, machine learning, and database algorithms. <br/><br/>The proposed research is closely tied to the development of the undergraduate and graduate curricula at UCSD, feeding into the PI's new undergraduate machine learning class, a new graduate learning theory class, and updates to an algorithm design and analysis class. The corresponding materials will be publicly disseminated through the PI's website. The PI is strongly committed to increasing the participation of women and minorities, and will engage in outreach activities to attract and retain women in computer science.

Abstract: To lower costs and improve outcomes in current medical practice we need integrated interoperable medical systems to provide machine-assisted care, interaction detection, and improved alarm accuracy, to name just a few uses. This project is developing both the theory and practice to ensure the safety of next-generation medical devices by allowing secure coordination and composition, in facilities as small as a local doctor's office or as large as a multi-campus hospital. Connected devices are part of a "medical coordination platform," which allows execution of "clinical workflows," such as having a blood pressure cuff automatically take a reading once an infusion pump stops delivering medication, or determining in real time whether prescribed medications are contraindicated by a patient's past health history.<br/><br/>Such manufacturer- and integrator-agnostic communication is difficult to bootstrap and perform securely, but security is required, since networked insecure systems are fundamentally unsafe. Furthermore, medicine is more complex than many other domains: security and quality of service properties must hold even environments where many different people have physical access to devices and communication infrastructure. Without fully trusting individual components, we must provide strong resource isolation, patient privacy protection, and real-time trust reasoning in highly-dynamic, adversarial, and life-critical systems.<br/><br/>We aim for speedy transition to practice by providing reusable security, privacy, and logging components for existing open medical application platforms, supporting varying hardware capabilities, laws, regulations, and facility-local policies, as well as software for pre-deployment and run-time trustworthiness reasoning about the system and individual devices.

Abstract: Secure Computation is a powerful concept from cryptography that enables collaboration in the absence of trust. Despite its great potential for solving practical problems in collaborative situations, it has not yet been widely adopted in practice. Indeed, until recently there were few practical implementations of secure computation protocols, and even recent implementations were forced to restrict themselves to weak forms of security for the sake of efficiency. This is because the dominant paradigm for achieving strong security, since the invention of the first such protocols, has relied on zero-knowledge proofs, and yields protocols that are too inefficient even for simple computations.<br/><br/>We are developing radically different new architectures for efficient secure computation protocols that bypass the need for such zero-knowledge proofs. Our architectures are based on a novel principled approach to developing new secure computation protocols, with consequences to the theory and practice of modern cryptography. Our research will identify new (partial) security properties inherent in simple protocols, and study how such properties can add up to strong security guarantees through carefully developed methods for composing protocols.<br/><br/>Secure multiparty computation is an idea whose time has come, as evidenced by the several projects around the world engaged in translating the theoretical results to practical implementations, and the number of research projects outside cryptography that seek to exploit it. Widespread availability and deployment of secure computation protocols has the potential to be a disruptive technology, enabling new avenues of cooperation in areas with sensitive information. Apart from the technological impact, we strive to bring the advances in cryptography to a broader computer science audience, by integrating our research into graduate and undergraduate education, and outreach efforts.

Abstract: JavaScript has transformed the way in which software systems are developed, deployed and extended. It is now used to build complex, security sensitive applications for communications, retail, and banking, and is even a primary building block of web browsers themselves. Unfortunately, the advent of JavaScript has also opened the door to new classes of security vulnerabilities, as applications manipulate security critical client information like browsing history, passwords, bank account numbers, social security numbers and so on. Worse, the absence of language-level isolation mechanisms makes it hard to establish confidentiality and integrity of key software components.<br/><br/>We believe that the key to making the web more secure is to develop a practical, precise and expressive type system for JavaScript and to use it as a foundation for developing security policies, analyses and enforcement mechanisms for JavaScript browser extensions and applications. Thus, we propose to develop a type system for JavaScript that is expressive enough to support JavaScript's dynamic idioms, practical enough to require minimal programmer intervention and hence, be capable of highly automated analysis of large code bases, and easily extensible enough to allow developers to specify and enforce different kinds of fine-grained security policies.<br/><br/>Our research will lead to the following contributions: End Users will be able to freely run extensions, plugins and rich browser applications from trusted sites, without having to suffer the plagues of code-injection, information exfiltration or the unpalatable cures of fully dynamic enforcement whose overhead can render sites unusable. Developers will be able to fully enjoy the fruits of static verification, in a familiar package: namely types. Types will allow developers to specify at the right granularity, the permissions required for some functionality, and will prevent the inadvertent vulnerabilities that are introduced by overprovisioning, or under-sanitization of data. Curators that aggregate third party applications (e.g. ``app stores" for various mobile platforms) will be able to use type-based certificates to quickly vet applications, thereby determining if an application is safe to host without compromising the reputation of the platform.

Abstract: Deep packet inspection (DPI) is a crucial tool for protecting networks from emerging and sophisticated attacks. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to implement DPI effectively due to the rising need for more complex analysis, combined with the relentless growth in the volume of network traffic that these systems must inspect. To address this challenge, future DPI technologies must exploit the power of emerging highly concurrent multi- and many-core platforms. Unfortunately, however, current DPI systems severely limit their use of parallelism by either resorting to coarse-grained load-balancing or restricting their analysis to very simple, hard-coded detectors.<br/><br/>In order to fully exploit parallel hardware platforms, in this project we develop a comprehensive approach that introduces parallelism across all stages of the complex DPI pipeline. We investigate application-independent scheduling strategies that take existing DPI analyses and automatically parallelize their processing. We do so by mapping them into a domain-specific intermediary representation that abstracts from specifics of the underlying hardware architecture while providing low-level consistency guarantees. Conceptually, the project's goal is to virtualize and abstract parallelism as a fundamental primitive, just like how virtual memory abstracts away physical memory size limitations from programmers.

Abstract: With the Internet becoming the dominant channel for marketing and promotion, online advertisements (ad for short) are also increasingly used for propagating malware, committing scams, click frauds and other illegal activities. These activities, which we call malvertising, systematically deliver malicious ad content and victimize visitors through an infrastructure, which includes malicious advertisers, ad networks, redirection servers, exploit servers and others. Our preliminary study shows that most of such malvertising activities are missed by popular detection services such as Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft Forefront. This points to a disturbing lack of understanding of such web malvertising activities, which renders existing countermeasures less effective, and an urgent need to study the features of this threat to better prepares us to defend against it. <br/><br/>The proposed research endeavors to gain a holistic, in-depth understanding about the scope and magnitude of malicious display, search and contextual advertising, features of their infrastructures and ad content, behavior of malicious ad-related parties, and economics of this underground business. Based upon such a understanding, we continue to develop novel infrastructure-aware technologies to detect these malicious activities, which include effective malvertising analysis techniques that capture malicious ads, advertisers and ad networks through web patrol, client-side defense that protects a user from stepping into exploit servers and publisher-side countermeasures that empower legitimate publishers and ad networks to shield their customers from such attacks. This research involves industry collaborators and also contributes to mitigation of other related threats such as black-hat Search Engine Optimization, SPAM-based phishing and drive-by-downloads.

Abstract: Perimeter security and air gap approaches to preventing malware disruption of industrial and infrastructure processes are challenged by the complexity of modern control systems incorporating networked heterogeneous and software-updatable components such as personal computers and programmable logic controllers. Global supply chains and proprietary third-party hardware components, tools, and software limit the reach of static design verification techniques. As a consequence, attacks such as Stuxnet have demonstrated that these systems can be surreptitiously compromised. We are developing a run-time method for process control violation prediction to enhance system resilience against configuration attacks on embedded controllers. This approach copes with either malicious or unintentional errors in any software layer of any programmable component. The run-time system includes a second instance of the active controller connected to a model of the plant, giving a short-term projection of future controller actions and process state. To maintain convergence with the physical system, the model's state is periodically synchronized with the plant's state. The predictor is combined with run-time guards implemented in a configurable hardware-anchored root-of-trust to quickly detect when the projected process state violates specifications. Aberrant event- or time-triggered controller behavior is anticipated before it affects the physical process, allowing preemptive switchover to a minimal and static stability-preserving controller. A productive model-based design flow is being extended to synthesize the active and backup controllers, prediction module, and specification guards into a single commercially-available chip. The root-of-trust can be formally verified due to its hardware implementation and independence.

Abstract: Coercion attacks that compel an authorized user to reveal his or her secret authentication credentials can give attackers access to restricted systems. The PIs are developing a new approach to preventing coercion attacks using the concept of implicit learning from cognitive psychology. Implicit learning refers to learning of patterns without any conscious knowledge of the learned pattern. Using a carefully crafted keyboard-based computer game the PIs plant a secret password in the participant's brain without the participant having any conscious knowledge of the trained password. This planted secret can be used for authentication, but participants cannot be coerced into revealing their secret since they have no conscious knowledge of it. <br/><br/>This project explores three directions for using implicit learning in computer security. First, the PIs are developing implicit learning tasks designed to be used in challenge-response authentication. Second, the PIs are experimenting with methods to demonstrate implicit knowledge by measuring electrical activity along the scalp using off the shelf EEG devices. Third, the PIs are conducting user experiments to demonstrate that participants are able to properly authenticate, but cannot consciously recognize the trained secret. This project is a collaboration between computer security researchers and cognitive psychologists. Ultimately, the project aims to understand how the brain represents implicit knowledge. This in turn will lead to new coercion resistant security mechanisms for high-security applications.

Abstract: The project explores the influence that offline cues and stimuli, indicating the presence of other human beings in the physical world, and often processed unconsciously by our brains, can have over security and privacy behavior in cyberspace. <br/><br/>The project is predicated around an evolutionary conjecture: Human beings have evolved to detect and react to threats in their physical environment, and have developed perceptual systems selected to assess these ?physical? stimuli for current, material risks. In cyberspace, the same stimuli often are absent, subdued, or intentionally manipulated by third parties. Hence, security and privacy concerns that would normally be activated in the offline world are restrained, and defense behaviors are hampered.<br/><br/>While it is impossible to test such conjecture directly, indirect evidence compatible with the conjecture can be obtained by investigating the impact that external stimuli in the physical world have on security and privacy behavior in cyberspace. The proposed research consists in a stream of human subjects controlled experiments investigating such impact of various sets of stimuli or cues. <br/><br/>This significance of this research is two-fold. First, it attempts to advance the scientific understanding of what makes security and privacy decision making in cyberspace uniquely different from, and sometimes more difficult than security and privacy in the physical world. Second, by investigating a factor that may significantly disrupt user behavior in cyberspace, the research findings could inspire the construction of systems that induce more secure behavior.

Abstract: Personal healthcare systems based on wearable/implantable medical devices are being increasingly deployed for a variety of diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic applications. A consequence of the increased functional complexity, software programmability, and wireless network connectivity of such devices is that they are now vulnerable to security attacks that have plagued general-purpose computing systems. Recent demonstration of security attacks on commercially deployed systems has raised medical device security concerns significantly. Unfortunately, medical devices come with extreme size/power constraints and unique usage models, making it infeasible to simply borrow conventional security solutions.<br/> <br/>This research focuses on developing a non-intrusive medical security monitor that snoops on all wireless communication to/from medical devices and uses multi-layered anomaly detection to identify potentially malicious transactions. While formal methods have been previously used to check for implementation flaws, they are not geared towards verifying the safety behavior of the medical device software in its interactions with the real world, which can expose logical flaws as well. The work investigates these interactions by transforming properties specified at the real-world interfaces (sensors and actuators) into program properties against which the medical device software can be verified. The findings will be disseminated through conferences and journals. The hardware and software developed will be placed in the public domain, and disseminated to the industry. The knowledge developed will be integrated into various courses. Undergraduates will be encouraged to perform independent research on this topic. Fellowships and outreach programs will be leveraged to encourage participation of female and minority students.

Abstract: Cryptographers have invented many different types of encryption. The PIs' research brings many of these under one umbrella, thereby reconceptualizing the landscape of modern cryptography. In the process, the research puts forward some entirely new kinds of encryption. The work is motivated by the needs of existing security practice. Sample questions include how to save space when storing encrypted copies of the same material in the cloud, and how to encrypt a credit-card number by reimagining the process as the shuffling of a deck of cards. The research demonstrates the practical benefits to cryptography and security from inclusive reinterpretations what encryption does.<br/><br/>In more detail, leaky encryption formalizes what it means to divulge some particular function of the message, unifying notions like blockciphers, online ciphers, and order-preserving encryption. Shuffle-based encryption creates blockciphers in a way fundamentally different from the way Feistel and SP networks do. Message-locked encryption can encrypt with a key derived from the message itself, to enable secure de-duplication. Password-based encryption incorporates a "salt" to provide what the PIs call multi-instance security. Circuit encryption can encrypt a circuit and its input to ciphertexts that permit the evaluation of the one on the other, but in a way that reveals only correctly computed result. These are just some of the aims the research encompasses.

Abstract: There are very few publicly available network traces that contain application-level data, because of the enormous privacy risk that sharing such data creates. Application-level data is rich with personal and private information, such as human names, social security numbers, etc. that criminals can monetize. Yet such data is necessary for realistic testing of research products, and for understanding trends in the domain of networking and network applications.<br/><br/>This project develops a publicly accessible, diverse and fresh archive of content-rich network data, contributed by volunteer users, called Critter-at-home. Users join the Critter overlay whenever online, offering their data to interested researchers. Privacy of data contributors is protected by several means. First, contributors may opt to host their own data on their machines, thus retaining full control over it. Second, we process contributed data to modify all personal and private information (PPI) and we encrypt it. Third, no human apart from the contributor ever accesses the raw, PPI-sanitized, data. Instead, researchers query the data via our Critter-at-home framework, and they receive aggregate statistics (counts, distributions, etc.) of the traffic features they query for. Four, all contact with a contributor is at her discretion and is done through an anonymous network, where contributor identities are hidden.<br/><br/>The archive this project creates will greatly advance security research by providing necessary data for its validation and for data mining. This archive will further be valuable to a broader networking e.g., for realistic traffic generation, as ground truth in traffic classification, and for many other purposes.

Abstract: Modern Web browsers provide a "private browsing" mode, wherein the browser does not record the user's behavior such as which sites they visited. This mode is valuable to users of all stripes, from the privacy-conscious to those those worried about persecution by totalitarian regimes. Browser implementers therefore take great care to try to ensure these modes function correctly. However, modern browsers are highly extensible: users can install extensions to customize their browser, and millions have done so. Unfortunately, it is technically challenging for browsers to automatically flag which extensions are privacy-preserving and which are not, so browsers currently do not attempt to offer such guidance -- leaving users to fend for themselves.<br/><br/>This work presents a type system for verifying whether extensions violate private browsing mode. The types distinguish Safe values (that may always be used in private mode) from Unsafe ones (that may lead to privacy violations). The type system is engineered to be<br/>"lightweight": extensions that never perform unsafe actions should type check without changes, and extension authors must only annotate their extension code when an unsafe action is used. Extensions that pass this check are accompanied by a guarantee that they do not perform privacy-violating actions, and are thus safe to install in private-browsing mode.

Abstract: One of the cornerstones of modern cryptography is that new constructions of cryptographic protocols should be accompanied by a proof of security. Such proofs show that a construction satisfies a given definition of security, under certain assumptions and in a specific model. Widely used models include various forms of setup (such as the existence of a public-key infrastructure or common reference string); idealized models such as the random oracle model where a hash function is treated as a truly random function; or hardware models where physical devices with some additional functionality are assumed.<br/><br/>Many of the models used widely in cryptography are still poorly understood, especially insofar as their relation to practice. The goal of this work is to develop a better understanding of these models, investigating in particular their relations and implications; the possibility of constructing cryptographic protocols in weaker (or at least incomparable) models; and the feasibility of designing schemes with "fallback" security that provide more basic security guarantees in case the assumed model fails.

Abstract: The Network File System (NFS) is a popular method for computers to access files across networks. The latest major version of this IETF protocol, version 4, is widely accepted and includes numerous new features to improve security, performance, and usability when used over wide-area networks. However, the NFSv4's security focus is on network-wide encryption (ensuring that user data cannot be intercepted) and user authentication (ensuring that only legitimate users can access their files); it does not address end-to-end data security (i.e., persistently stored data), does not address data integrity (malicious or benign data corruptions), and more.<br/><br/>This project extends NFSv4 with a security layer that allows one to develop multiple, composable plugin modules to enhance the protocol's security. This layer allows for interception of protocol requests between clients and servers to perform various useful security functions: logging access to files by users and hosts, useful for regulatory compliance reports and audits; inspecting files for malware patterns and automatically quarantining them; verifying the integrity of long-lived files against malicious changes (e.g., Trojan intrusions) and benign but serious ones (e.g., storage media degradation and hardware corruptions); detecting denial-of-service attempts and ensuring quality-of-service to legitimate users through load-balancing and redirection; automatic snapshotting and logging to allow for forensic analysis and recovery from failures and intrusions. In a cloud-based era where more data lives longer and is accessed over wide-area, insecure networks, this project helps elevate the level of security of every user's data files.

Abstract: The security of our software is critical for consumer confidence, the protection of privacy and valuable intellectual property, and of course national security. Because of our society's increased reliance on software, security breaches can lead to serious personal or corporate losses, and endanger the privacy, liberties, and even the lives of individuals. As threats to software security have become more sophisticated, so too have the techniques and analyses developed to improve it. Symbolic execution has emerged as a fundamental tool for security applications. Its main idea is to run a program using symbolic instead of concrete values: a set of symbols are assigned to the program inputs, and the outputs are expressed as a set of "verification conditions", logical formulas over the input symbols. A number of successful security analyses use symbolic execution and similar methods to recast security questions about programs as constraint satisfaction problems in some formal logic. Automatic reasoners for that logic can then be used to solve those problems. In the last few years, solvers based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) techniques have become a natural choice in such approaches to security because of their superior performance and automation compared to more traditional theorem provers and their greater generality with respect to ad-hoc tools or propositional satisfiability solvers.<br/><br/>This collaborative project brings together experts in security and in SMT to pursue two complementary research goals: (i) harness the full power of SMT solvers to improve current security tools based on symbolic analysis; and (ii) design and develop new techniques to address the needs of anticipated future security applications. Specific activities addressing these goals include: collecting challenge benchmark problems from existing security analyses and developing targeted SMT optimizations for these benchmarks; developing appropriate security abstractions in the SMT language used to express security verification conditions; developing logical theories and algorithms for reasoning about character strings in such verification conditions; exposing a general framework for extending the verification condition language; and developing techniques for computing symbolic solution sets for SMT constraints. These activities are expected to (i) significantly increase the flexibility, performance, and reasoning capabilities of SMT solvers in support of security applications; (ii) improve the performance and scalability of current security analyses by leveraging the reasoning power of SMT solvers; and (iii) provide a foundation for new, more powerful, and more expressive security analyses. Overall, this project will help create more scalable and expressive security applications which could have a considerable impact on society as they enable the production of software much more resistant to security attacks.

Abstract: Software is a critical element in a wide range of real-world applications. Attacks against computer software can cause substantial damage to the cyber-infrastructure of our modern society and economy. In fact, many new software security vulnerabilities are discovered on a daily basis. Therefore, it is vital to identify and resolve those security issues as early as possible. This research aims to investigate a scientific foundation and a novel methodology for automated detection, prevention, and resolution of prior-known software security vulnerabilities in software systems. The results will help to detect and prevent prior-known security vulnerabilities from recurring in other software systems.<br/> <br/>In this research, the key philosophy is that the software systems having the same/similar software security vulnerabilities share the protocols, algorithms, procedures, libraries, frameworks, modules, or source code with the same flaws, and they suffer the same/similar exploitation mechanisms. Based on that, empirical studies are conducted to investigate the nature and the characteristics of recurring software vulnerabilities in different software systems, and to validate that hypothesis. Based on the knowledge gained from the studies, new vulnerability models, representations, and similarity measurements are developed to capture recurring software security vulnerabilities, and the corresponding vulnerable code and exploitation mechanisms. Novel algorithms and techniques are designed to (semi-)automatically build graph-based vulnerability models from vulnerability reports and from vulnerable code and patches, aiming to construct a database of prior-known vulnerabilities. A new methodology is developed to help to identify the prior-known vulnerabilities in other systems and to suggest the resolution. Specifically, the automated methods and advances include 1) an algorithm to compare and match against vulnerability models in the database, 2) a technique to map software concepts between security reports and from a report to the corresponding source code fragments, modules, or components; 3) an algorithm to determine the modules and source file locations in the new system that correspond to the vulnerable modules and locations in a system with a prior-known vulnerability; and 4) a technique to suggest the patch to the new system from the prior fixes. In brief, the results of this research help to resolve early software security vulnerabilities. They will lead to more reliable software because the process of detecting and patching for recurring security vulnerabilities will be more efficient and effective.

Abstract: The recent explosion in malware poses financial, privacy, and safety risks. This project explores a fundamentally new approach to malware detection that promises to be faster, more effective, and cheaper than current tools.<br/><br/>The evolution of malicious software, or malware, has seen increases in both malware's capabilities and sheer volume. Recent malware makes use of a number of sophisticated technologies including polymorphism, public key encryption, and peer-to-peer architectures. These advances are driven by significant resources put into malware development by both criminal enterprises and countries. Traditional malware detection tools rely on slow manual processes and the recent advances in malware have outrun the ability of existing tools to cope.<br/><br/>This project uses a new approach to the malware crisis that centers around constructive use of crowd-sourcing. The key insight is that the collection of machines on the Internet contains information that can be used to automatically classify software as either legitimate or malicious. This information includes not only the behavior of malware on individual machines but also the behavior of the aggregate population. For example, the aggregate statistics of how software propagates across the network can provide insight into whether the software is malicious.<br/><br/>A key component of the proposed work is binary translation-based dynamic signatures. Traditional malware detection tools have used static signatures, but polymorphic techniques have made this approach significantly more difficult. The project employs binary translation to efficiently collect dynamic traces for both code execution and behavioral events such as network communication and then generate signatures for these traces.<br/><br/>The project significantly reduces the threats of malware to society, especially since software developed through the project is freely available. The project is mentoring members of underrepresented minorities, and is infusing its ideas into the curriculum.

Abstract: This project investigates the feasibility of secure, robust, and usable gesture-based authentication as an alternative to traditional alphanumeric passwords and biometrics. It is motivated by the rapid increase in authentication-related security breaches and by the emergence of new human-computer interfaces. While the breaches have demonstrated the seriousness of the issue, two emerging types of gesture-based interfaces, multi-touch (smartphones, tablets) and camera-based (Kinect), offer a unique opportunity for robust solution.<br/><br/>The benefit of gesture-based authentication over a purely-biometric one lies in the fact that it combines involuntary biometric features (e.g., hand shape), that are irrevocable, with user-controlled voluntary characteristics that can be easily changed. Three research thrusts are being pursued: 1) gesture recognition algorithms (search for robust gesture features, their compact representation, and reliable classification algorithms), 2) human factors (study of uniqueness, repeatability, ergonomics, device dependence of gestures, and gesture complexity) and 3) security considerations (evaluation of authentication performance under a range of performance measures and different threat models). <br/><br/>A successful completion of this research will catalyze the development and adoption of next-generation authentication methods that are critically needed at the personal, institutional, and governmental levels. As the price paid (time, money, and resources) to repair a security breach can be astounding, this project will have substantial societal impact by increasing the sense of security and reducing breach-related costs. At educational level, this project is involved in middle and high school outreach at Boston University as well as the annual cybsersecurity competition CSAW at NYU-Poly.

Abstract: Mobile browsers are beginning to serve as critical enablers of modern computing. With a combination of rich features that rival their desktop counterparts and strong security mechanisms such as TLS/SSL, these mobile browsers are becoming the basis of many other mobile apps. Unfortunately, the security guarantees provided by mobile browsers and the risks associated with today?s mobile web have not been evaluated in great detail. This project investigates the security of mobile browsers, the applications that build on them through APIs such as WebViews and the mobile specific websites they access. This research differs significantly from prior work; whereas previous research has focused largely on stand-alone, third-party applications, our work focuses on mobile browsers and the increasing number of applications using them as their basis for delivering content. Moreover, our work measures the extent to which the mobile web itself is vulnerable. The combination of these efforts aims to create the first longitudinal and principled study of the mobile web ecosystem.

Abstract: This project is developing tools and techniques for cost-effective evaluation of the trustworthiness of mobile applications (apps). The work focuses on enterprise scenarios, in which personnel at a business or government agency use mission-related apps and access enterprise networks.<br/><br/>In such scenarios there are incentives and resources for much more substantive evaluations and controls on information flow than are currently found in commodity app marketplaces. The project aims to advance the science needed for static techniques to be usable by professional development and evaluation teams and useful for achieving dramatically improved assurance. The project's goals are to: (a) find flexible and expressive ways to specify information flow requirements for apps, (b) find effective ways to specify what is assumed about the Android platform, and (c) find practical static analysis and verification techniques to check security of apps with respect to given policies and the platform. Results include specification techniques and theory - models and algorithms. These are applied in case studies with prototype tools that the project develops, to evaluate how well the goals are achieved.<br/><br/>The project's techniques can be deployed by certification organizations to provide scientifically sound techniques for assurance, thus<br/>enabling the full benefits of highly-integrated mobile software in mission-critical situations. Software designers will benefit from being able to precisely specify end-to-end requirements as well as component interfaces. Software developers will benefit from reliable means to detect design flaws and bugs, malware in third-party software, and unintended functionality that exposes vulnerabilities. Beyond the specific target of mobile software, the techniques will be of use in other settings, especially web applications, where it is crucial to reason about interfaces between mutually untrusting parties making heavy use of callbacks. The project could help improve security in government agencies and private sector, indirectly benefitting national security and the general population.

Abstract: Deep packet inspection (DPI) is a crucial tool for protecting networks from emerging and sophisticated attacks. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to implement DPI effectively due to the rising need for more complex analysis, combined with the relentless growth in the volume of network traffic that these systems must inspect. To address this challenge, future DPI technologies must exploit the power of emerging highly concurrent multi- and many-core platforms. Unfortunately, however, current DPI systems severely limit their use of parallelism by either resorting to coarse-grained load-balancing or restricting their analysis to very simple, hard-coded detectors.<br/><br/>In order to fully exploit parallel hardware platforms, in this project we develop a comprehensive approach that introduces parallelism across all stages of the complex DPI pipeline. We investigate application-independent scheduling strategies that take existing DPI analyses and automatically parallelize their processing. We do so by mapping them into a domain-specific intermediary representation that abstracts from specifics of the underlying hardware architecture while providing low-level consistency guarantees. Conceptually, the project's goal is to virtualize and abstract parallelism as a fundamental primitive, just like how virtual memory abstracts away physical memory size limitations from programmers.

Abstract: Modern computer systems are too complex to be analyzed directly, and often mathematical models are employed to analyze such computer systems to understand how well they function and whether they operate correctly. The area of computational models is devoted to constructing such models, and to their application to solve problems in computing, such as specifying computational devices designed to solve specific problems. Quite distinct from this, the area of Diophantine approximation from number theory studies how well real numbers can be approximated by rational numbers - ones that can be expressed a quotient of two integers. Despite dating back to the time of Diophantus of Alexandria, there are many deep questions here that remain unsolved. Finally, the study of classical communication channels forms the basis for the area of classical information theory that plays a fundamental role in many aspects of everyday life. This project will explore relationships between emerging techniques for building computational models, and research in classical information and in Diophantine approximation. These represent very diverse areas of mathematics, computer science and information theory, and a goal of the project is to develop links between them that reveal common underlying principles that can be applied to solve problems in each area. Such principles will lead to methods that can be used from one area to solve problems in the other areas. <br/><br/>The proposed work spans a number of research areas: domain theory and computational models; topological games; classical information and families of classical channels; analysis of complex systems; and applications to Schmidt games and Diophantine approximation. Recent results on channel capacity that underpin the work are based on a topological view of channels and their capacity that offers a unique way to analyze related families of channels. The proposed analysis of existing approaches to constructing domain models of spaces - the co-algebraic approach as opposed to one based on Choquet games - will explore the relationship between these approaches, and will provide insights into their applicability to new and interesting problems in the range of areas listed above. Using domain-theoretic approaches to analyze Schmidt games is a novel idea that should prove useful in understanding these games and how they differ from ones such as Choquet games.

Abstract: Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud computing systems are revolutionizing business, government, and science by providing easy access to scalable computing. These public services, as offered by Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others, allow an arbitrary customer to rent, by the hour, the resources needed to run their applications within virtual machines (VMs) hosted on the provider?s compute infrastructure. With these new services, however, comes subtle new security issues. Prior work by the PI uncovered attacks that abuse two aspects unique to cloud computing: resource sharing among mutually distrustful customers and pricing that incentivizes malicious behavior. <br/><br/>The proposed research is organized along the two themes of resource sharing and pricing. In the first theme, the work explores whether cryptographic side channel attacks and resource-freeing attacks pose serious threats to cloud customers and then develops new placement and CPU scheduling algorithms that realize the security principle of soft isolation: minimization of potentially dangerous cross-user scheduling interactions (e.g., sharing a server or CPU core). Within the second theme, the work explores the implications of fine-grained pricing mechanisms on security. This includes developing pricemarks (mechanisms for accurately determining the true costs of a cloud service), understanding customer-controlled placement gaming that exploits cloud performance heterogeneity, and explores pricing-based security mechanisms that, in conjunction with the aforementioned scheduling mechanisms, will degrade fiscal incentivizes for adversarial behavior. <br/><br/>The impact of the proposed work will be deeper understanding of threats in cloud IaaS systems, new security design principles, deployable security technologies, and improvements in security education.

Abstract: Much of the internet's business is conducted with dynamically generated documents --- HTML pages, SQL queries, and execution scripts --- that are generated on-the-fly by document-generator scripts written in PHP, Javascript, and JSP. The situation is a threat to internet security because the document-generator scripts are often faulty, generating malformed documents that are vulnerable to attackers. To remove this vulnerability, a new approach, abstract parsing, is developed and applied to enforce, in advance of execution, that every dynamically generated document emitted from a script will be grammatically well formed (spelled correctly). The technique also predicts the range of semantics (intended meanings) of the generated documents, to help prevent attacker exploitation. The impact of the research lies in its tools and methodologies to help programmers assemble a more secure internet.<br/><br/>The technical approach starts from a document-generator script and a context-free reference grammar for the document language and generates an LALR(1)-parser from the grammar, applying it within a data-flow analysis of the script to predict the LALR-grammatical structure of the string-documents to be generated by the script. The analysis computes abstract LALR-parse stacks that overapproximate the grammatical structure of the string-documents that the script generates. <br/>Attribute-grammar machinery predicts the context-sensitive and semantical properties of the documents to be generated. The technology is applied to (i) generate a semantically-aware implementation of taint analysis; (ii) implement automata-defined filters for dynamic string updates; (iii) combine abstract-interpretation technology with abstract parsing to analyze a wider class of program constructions, in particular, dictionary data structures.

Abstract: Content distribution is an important application domain for cryptographic techniques. Existing security solutions for multi recipient communication, like broadcast encryption, focus mostly on the concerns of the content originator. This project tackles the problem from a broader perspective that includes the privacy concerns of the recipients, and develops cryptographic models and protocols for content distribution that provide guarantees beyond the mere secrecy of the data. The outcomes of this research will enable solutions that address the privacy issues associated with cloud storage. The techniques developed in the course of the research will be stimulating for researchers across the cryptography and information-hiding communities, thus potentially fostering collaborations between the fields. <br/><br/>The project has four specific research objectives: (1) the design of cryptographic constructions for receiver-anonymous broadcast encryption that at once provide transmission secrecy, afford anonymity to the receivers, and enjoy performance comparable to standard broadcast encryption; (2) the exploration of the relationship between receiver anonymity and ciphertext ambiguity, which refers to the possibility that a given ciphertext might appear valid to multiple decryptors; (3) the formulation of the concept of broadcast steganography to enable the use of a broadcast channel as a medium for covert communication; and (4) the investigation of applications like collaborative remote storage, whereby a group of users accesses shared content in the cloud privately and obliviously.

Abstract: The security of our software is critical for consumer confidence, the protection of privacy and valuable intellectual property, and of course national security. Because of our society's increased reliance on software, security breaches can lead to serious personal or corporate losses, and endanger the privacy, liberties, and even the lives of individuals. As threats to software security have become more sophisticated, so too have the techniques and analyses developed to improve it. Symbolic execution has emerged as a fundamental tool for security applications. Its main idea is to run a program using symbolic instead of concrete values: a set of symbols are assigned to the program inputs, and the outputs are expressed as a set of "verification conditions", logical formulas over the input symbols. A number of successful security analyses use symbolic execution and similar methods to recast security questions about programs as constraint satisfaction problems in some formal logic. Automatic reasoners for that logic can then be used to solve those problems. In the last few years, solvers based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) techniques have become a natural choice in such approaches to security because of their superior performance and automation compared to more traditional theorem provers and their greater generality with respect to ad-hoc tools or propositional satisfiability solvers.<br/><br/>This collaborative project brings together experts in security and in SMT to pursue two complementary research goals: (i) harness the full power of SMT solvers to improve current security tools based on symbolic analysis; and (ii) design and develop new techniques to address the needs of anticipated future security applications. Specific activities addressing these goals include: collecting challenge benchmark problems from existing security analyses and developing targeted SMT optimizations for these benchmarks; developing appropriate security abstractions in the SMT language used to express security verification conditions; developing logical theories and algorithms for reasoning about character strings in such verification conditions; exposing a general framework for extending the verification condition language; and developing techniques for computing symbolic solution sets for SMT constraints. These activities are expected to (i) significantly increase the flexibility, performance, and reasoning capabilities of SMT solvers in support of security applications; (ii) improve the performance and scalability of current security analyses by leveraging the reasoning power of SMT solvers; and (iii) provide a foundation for new, more powerful, and more expressive security analyses. Overall, this project will help create more scalable and expressive security applications which could have a considerable impact on society as they enable the production of software much more resistant to security attacks.

Abstract: This project is developing new techniques for manipulating sensitive data by exploring two related areas, computing on private keys and computing on authenticated data. Currently, a private key is an inert object that gives its holder the ability to perform a cryptographic operation on all messages, as may be the case when generating a signature. The project is exploring a new vision, in which computing on the private key itself creates new restricted private keys that can only perform restricted operations such as, for example, signing only some messages but not others. In the case of computing on authenticated data -- data for which integrity is important but secrecy is not -- the project is developing new tools to compute on such data and obtain authenticated results.<br/><br/>The project is committed to the dissemination of research results, education of students, and outreach to industry. Overall, the proposed project will produce a next generation of technology for managing authenticated and encrypted data while advancing the field of applied cryptography and educating the next generation of researchers.

Abstract: Coercion attacks that compel an authorized user to reveal his or her secret authentication credentials can give attackers access to restricted systems. The PIs are developing a new approach to preventing coercion attacks using the concept of implicit learning from cognitive psychology. Implicit learning refers to learning of patterns without any conscious knowledge of the learned pattern. Using a carefully crafted keyboard-based computer game the PIs plant a secret password in the participant's brain without the participant having any conscious knowledge of the trained password. This planted secret can be used for authentication, but participants cannot be coerced into revealing their secret since they have no conscious knowledge of it. <br/><br/>This project explores three directions for using implicit learning in computer security. First, the PIs are developing implicit learning tasks designed to be used in challenge-response authentication. Second, the PIs are experimenting with methods to demonstrate implicit knowledge by measuring electrical activity along the scalp using off the shelf EEG devices. Third, the PIs are conducting user experiments to demonstrate that participants are able to properly authenticate, but cannot consciously recognize the trained secret. This project is a collaboration between computer security researchers and cognitive psychologists. Ultimately, the project aims to understand how the brain represents implicit knowledge. This in turn will lead to new coercion resistant security mechanisms for high-security applications.

Abstract: Secure Computation is a powerful concept from cryptography that enables collaboration in the absence of trust. Despite its great potential for solving practical problems in collaborative situations, it has not yet been widely adopted in practice. Indeed, until recently there were few practical implementations of secure computation protocols, and even recent implementations were forced to restrict themselves to weak forms of security for the sake of efficiency. This is because the dominant paradigm for achieving strong security, since the invention of the first such protocols, has relied on zero-knowledge proofs, and yields protocols that are too inefficient even for simple computations.<br/><br/>We are developing radically different new architectures for efficient secure computation protocols that bypass the need for such zero-knowledge proofs. Our architectures are based on a novel principled approach to developing new secure computation protocols, with consequences to the theory and practice of modern cryptography. Our research will identify new (partial) security properties inherent in simple protocols, and study how such properties can add up to strong security guarantees through carefully developed methods for composing protocols.<br/><br/>Secure multiparty computation is an idea whose time has come, as evidenced by the several projects around the world engaged in translating the theoretical results to practical implementations, and the number of research projects outside cryptography that seek to exploit it. Widespread availability and deployment of secure computation protocols has the potential to be a disruptive technology, enabling new avenues of cooperation in areas with sensitive information. Apart from the technological impact, we strive to bring the advances in cryptography to a broader computer science audience, by integrating our research into graduate and undergraduate education, and outreach efforts.

Abstract: The web browser is ubiquitous and indispensable. It runs applications<br/>like social networking, business productivity, and online banking, and<br/>promises isolation policies that keep these applications secure when<br/>run side-by-side. Because of its crucial role, we would like the<br/>browser to be robust and secure against attack; but in fact browsers<br/>are fragile. They are complex pieces of software with rich features<br/>that allow for flexibility and programmability, and even small bugs<br/>can make the browser vulnerable to attack. Indeed, browser<br/>vulnerabilities have been used to infiltrate the internal networks of<br/>American defense contractors and leading tech firms. Attempts to<br/>improve browser security are often ad-hoc engineering efforts; and<br/>even when formal guarantees are provided, they come in the form of<br/>proofs over a model or idealization of the browser, not the browser<br/>itself. A buggy implementation can invalidate intended guarantees and<br/>leave users open to attack.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of this project is to build a browser inside the Coq proof<br/>assistant, along with a proof of its correctness. Unlike previous<br/>research efforts, the proof covers the actual browser implementation<br/>rather than a model or abstraction. This provides extremely strong,<br/>precise guarantees about the security properties of the browser. The<br/>proof is made tractable by focusing the verification effort to a small<br/>browser kernel, and running legacy code in a sandbox to render<br/>web pages. In this way, the browser can provide meaningful isolation<br/>guarantees even when the legacy code that renders web pages is<br/>untrusted and potentially buggy.<br/><br/><br/>This project will provide:<br/>* For users of the web, browsers that are more reliable and secure;<br/>* For software developers, a new approach for developing high-assurance systems;<br/>* For researchers, a framework for formally reasoning about security policies;<br/>* For students, security and formal methods education.

Abstract: The most fundamental service for the delivery of data on the Internet is routing, the task of computing the path that messages must follow in order to go between networks that are not directly connected. While a large body of work has studied the task of ensuring that these paths are computed correctly, surprisingly little work has been done to study the behavior, when under attack, of the system of computers, software and protocols that compute these paths, what we call the routing system. <br/><br/>This project is investigating the resilience of the Internet routing system to attacks that induce "churn" by forcing programs or computers to (temporarily) stop participating in the routing system. The project is devising experiments and simulations that will allow the development of mathematical models that can measure the vulnerability of the routing system to "cascading failures," caused by resource depletion, software faults, and protocol errors, that cause the entire routing system to become unavailable. The project is also developing methods to mitigate the effects of these attacks.<br/><br/>The project is expected to result in new data, models, and software that can be used by the community to evaluate and improve the behavior of the current routing system and proposed "future Internet" designs under destabilizing attacks, positively impacting the safety and economic health of the United States and other nations.

Abstract: The objective of this project is to help developers in making applications? usage of personal information transparent to mobile phone users, system integrators, and other evaluators. Recent well-publicized mobile privacy incidents have demonstrated all these parties have lost count of what information mobile devices collect, store, and transmit. A successful project would lead to improved privacy and application transparency, and would help prevent future privacy compromises. Project results could be adopted into mobile operating systems and could guide FTC policy on mobile privacy. The project includes close collaboration with industry stakeholders to facilitate dissemination of new ideas. Work will be conducted with graduate and undergraduate students, which will not only provide them with training in research methodology, but also expose them to important ethical questions surrounding privacy issues in mobile applications.<br/><br/>This project will aid developers and nudge them to follow privacy principles by making their usage of personal information transparent. Towards this end, this project will develop guidelines for privacy-aware system APIs that encourage developers to employ privacy-by-design techniques. For example, system APIs designed from a privacy perspective will make it easier to obtain more general information, rather than potentially more sensitive, fine-grained personal information. Through case studies with developers and users, this project is expected to lead to novel insights into the effectiveness of these techniques.

Abstract: Embedded systems currently rely on local and often insecure state retention for process control and subsequent forensic analysis. As critical embedded control systems (e.g., smart grids, SCADA) generate increasing amounts of data and become ever more connected to other systems, secure retention and management of that data is required. Attacks such as Stuxnet show that SCADA and other systems comprising critical infrastructure are vulnerable to the compromise of controllers and sensing devices, as well as falsification of data to circumvent anomaly detection mechanisms. <br/><br/>This project develops techniques and architectures for securely storing and monitoring embedded system state in critical infrastructure. We are examining vulnerabilities relating to generating and storing data in critical embedded systems, which are often resource-constrained environments. We propose the design and deployment of 'autonomously secure storage devices' that act as resilient storage for embedded devices. We are designing logging, audit, and management architectures for resiliently storing system data and provenance in the face of malicious and compromised devices. Additionally, we explore how this data may be disseminated to other systems and to environments such as the cloud and aim to protect data through privacy-preserving communication and querying interfaces, and attempt to make data-driven inferences about system operation to detect anomalous behavior. Through these active protections to generated data and metadata, we aim to provide a new baseline for producing and storing data generated within critical infrastructures.

Abstract: The goal of our work is to (a) capture people's expectations and surprises in using mobile apps in a scalable manner, and to (b) summarize these perceptions in a simple format to help people make better trust decisions. Our main idea is analyzing privacy in the form of people's expectations about what an app will and won't do, focusing on where an app breaks people's expectations. We are building an App Scanner that combines automated scanning techniques with crowdsourcing. Automated scanning captures the behavior of an app, while crowdsourcing is used to interpret how expected and acceptable this behavior is. This information is used as the basis for building a better privacy summary for apps. We have organized an interdisciplinary team with expertise in mobile computing, computer security, systems, and human-computer interaction.<br/><br/>Success in this work will include results in: (a) the design and implementation of an App Scanner that combines automated techniques with crowdsourcing techniques for analyzing and interpreting privacy-related behaviors of mobile apps; (b) a series of evaluations of this app scanner, showing effectiveness, accuracy, and scalability; (c) the design and evaluation of better privacy summaries, which prioritize and highlight the most unexpected behaviors of an app; and (d) demonstration of a new conceptualization of privacy, namely privacy as expectations. Success will also help end-users, corporate and government employees manage their privacy better than can be done today.

Abstract: The operating system (OS) exercises complete control over applications, thus a compromise of the OS compromises every application. Software developers have little recourse to improve security in the face of system compromise---they cannot defend against OS vulnerabilities, nor can they reasonably substitute a secure version of the millions of lines of code that constitute a modern OS.<br/><br/>Rather than require applications to blindly trust OS interactions, this project investigates a system architecture that enables trusted applications to efficiently verify OS interactions with the help of a small, trusted hypervisor. Most verification work is performed within the C language runtime, minimizing changes to legacy code and shielding developers from increased programming complexity.<br/>The prototype system, called InkTag,improves upon prior work in several key areas: it provides more efficient techniques to verify system call results, implements usable access control for resources managed by an untrusted OS, and introduces hardware and software techniques to further reduce the size of the trusted computing base.<br/><br/>Cloud computing provides energy and economic efficiencies, but suffers from the inability to give meaningful security guarantees to hosted applications. This project demonstrates that system security is possible without trusting the OS---a large part of the hosted infrastructure. This project is also developing new materials for undergraduate and graduate curricula that combine core knowledge of systems with an understanding of how systems provide security properties, equipping future computer professionals with a better understanding of what security guarantees a system can meaningfully provide.

Abstract: This project is developing tools and techniques for cost-effective evaluation of the trustworthiness of mobile applications (apps). The work focuses on enterprise scenarios, in which personnel at a business or government agency use mission-related apps and access enterprise networks.<br/><br/>In such scenarios there are incentives and resources for much more substantive evaluations and controls on information flow than are currently found in commodity app marketplaces. The project aims to advance the science needed for static techniques to be usable by professional development and evaluation teams and useful for achieving dramatically improved assurance. The project's goals are to: (a) find flexible and expressive ways to specify information flow requirements for apps, (b) find effective ways to specify what is assumed about the Android platform, and (c) find practical static analysis and verification techniques to check security of apps with respect to given policies and the platform. Results include specification techniques and theory - models and algorithms. These are applied in case studies with prototype tools that the project develops, to evaluate how well the goals are achieved.<br/><br/>The project's techniques can be deployed by certification organizations to provide scientifically sound techniques for assurance, thus<br/>enabling the full benefits of highly-integrated mobile software in mission-critical situations. Software designers will benefit from being able to precisely specify end-to-end requirements as well as component interfaces. Software developers will benefit from reliable means to detect design flaws and bugs, malware in third-party software, and unintended functionality that exposes vulnerabilities. Beyond the specific target of mobile software, the techniques will be of use in other settings, especially web applications, where it is crucial to reason about interfaces between mutually untrusting parties making heavy use of callbacks. The project could help improve security in government agencies and private sector, indirectly benefitting national security and the general population.

Abstract: Growing energy demands and environmental concerns have significantly increased the interest of academia, industry, and governments in the development of a smart electric power grid. Security is one of the key aspects of power systems. The objective of this research is to advance methods of vulnerability analysis and to develop innovative responses to maintain the integrity of power grids under complex attacks (both cyber attacks and physical failures). This research will contribute to developing robust, secure, and reliable future smart grid systems. <br/><br/>Unlike many of the existing efforts that focuses on abstract topological structure or load-based analysis, this project considers both network topology and intrinsic power flow characteristics to understand system behavior in complex power grid attacks. This includes single-node and multiple-node vulnerability analysis, development of new risk-aware metrics, spatial-temporal attacks with consideration of timing and location, and multifaceted attacks augmented by link failures. Knowledge of power grid system behavior under attack scenarios will allow us to develop new defense strategies. <br/><br/>As power and energy systems have become one of the key technology and economic development focuses across the world, this project will have far-reaching impacts at different levels. This includes enhancing national power system security, providing technical support to government agencies and policy-makers for the U.S. energy sustainability community, and student education and workforce preparation in this field. The integrative educational and outreach approaches will also provide a unique platform to encourage women and minority students to the critical Electrical/Computer Engineering disciplines.

Abstract: In this project, we are exploring the association between computing tasks (jobs) and the computing resources assigned to run those jobs to improve the ability to deploy tasks to satisfy security requirements. Historically, the owners of the computing tasks also owned their computing resources, so they configured their resources to run their tasks efficiently and securely. However, configuring tasks to run securely has become so complex that the key knowledge is now distributed among several parties: cloud vendors configure host systems, OS distributors configure cloud instances, customers configure their application programs and network policies. The goal is to be able to collect this expertise into a single model to reason about how to deploy computing tasks to satisfy their security requirements. To do this, we are integrating the myriad of integrity measurement mechanisms into a comprehensive integrity measurement framework to enable reasoning about the satisfaction of a computing task's data security from installation to completion. Using this model, we are building a customer-centric utility computing service to choose an assignment of resources for computing tasks that satisfies data security requirements. When a customer deploys a computing task via such a service, the service will construct integrity-verified channels to her running jobs, which are secure communication channels that guarantee that the data sender adheres to a data security policy. Using such services, customers will be able to deploy computing jobs among cloud resources managed by several parties, while assuring that their data security requirements are satisfied automatically.

Abstract: In this age of identity theft, Facebook, and TSA screening, protecting confidential information from improper disclosure has emerged as a fundamental issue for trustworthy computing, involving both technical and social dimensions. While it is sometimes possible to stop undesirable information flows completely, it is perhaps more typical that some undesirable flows are unavoidable. For instance an ATM machine that rejects an incorrect PIN thereby reveals that the secret PIN is not the one that was entered. Similarly, revealing the tally of votes in an election reveals some information about the secret ballots that were cast. More subtly, the amount of time taken by a cryptographic operation may be observable by an adversary, and may inadvertently reveal information about the secret key. As a result, there is growing interest in quantitative theories of information flow, which allow us to talk about "how much" information is leaked and (perhaps) allow us to tolerate "small" leaks. But while it is tempting to base such theories on classic information-theoretic concepts like Shannon entropy and mutual information, these turn out not to provide very satisfactory confidentiality guarantees. As a result, several researchers have developed an alternative theory, based instead on Renyi's min-entropy, which gives strong, direct operational security guarantees.<br/><br/>This project aims to deepen our understanding of the theory and applications of min-entropy leakage by pursuing several themes concurrently. In the theory of min-entropy leakage, uncertainty is measured in terms of a random variable's vulnerability to being guessed in one try by an adversary; note that this is the complement of the Bayes Risk. The mathematical properties of this theory will be explored for both deterministic and probabilistic systems, with the goal of better understanding the relationship to other theories, such as mutual information leakage and differential privacy. A variant called smooth min-entropy leakage will be developed, giving a measure that is less sensitive to extremely unlikely events. To support the compositional analysis of complex systems, leakage bounds will be established for channels in cascade, where the output of one channel becomes the input to another; moreover, algorithms will be developed for approximately factoring a channel into a cascade, giving a technique for automatic sanitization. Techniques will be developed for computing the min-entropy leakage of systems, giving a way to verify whether they conform to a given quantitative flow policy; both model-checking and statistical-sampling based techniques will be considered. Finally, applications of min-entropy leakage will be explored, for example to accountability systems that use logging and auditing to identify misbehaving entities. These efforts will develop new theory, enforcement techniques, and applications of min-entropy leakage, contributing broadly to a rigorous science of quantitative information flow.

Building on the 2011 and 2012 events, the funding from this grant will support student travel from more remote areas within Oregon to be able to come to Eugene for the event.<br/><br/>The Security Day event is an opportunity for students and members of the community to be exposed to trends and new topics in computer security and to discuss ongoing research initiatives. It is also an opportunity to form new collaborations.<br/><br/>Exposure to nationally-recognized speakers in security for students and others throughout the state of Oregon, particularly from underserved areas who would not be able to receive this access otherwise, aids in the pedagogical and outreach mission of the university and can be an encouraging factor for more students to consider graduate-level study in the area of computer security.

Abstract: JavaScript is the lingua franca of modern Internet computing. Unlike traditional code, JavaScript is highly dynamic and malleable. While JavaScript is increasingly used in security-critical applications that manipulate sensitive information like banking information and social security numbers, Web browsers' sandboxing mechanism for JavaScript (the "same-origin policy") is too coarse to adequately secure "mashups" that combine code at runtime from mutually distrusting origins.<br/><br/>This project provides tools to secure JavaScript applications from buggy or malicious code by enforcing security policies, written by developers and users, that specify what code should be trusted and what data must be protected.<br/><br/>Faced with dynamic applications like mashups, traditional enforcement mechanisms call for either one incomplete initial analysis or expensive from-scratch re-analysis whenever code is added. This project instead introduces staged program analysis. At each stage, as much analysis as possible is performed as possible given the known code; the remainder of the analysis computation is deferred until more code becomes available.<br/><br/>The system, implemented in a browser and evaluated on real Web sites, must be scalable enough to use with complex, popular sites; precise enough to produce few false positives; efficient enough to run on end users' browsers without noticeable performance degradation; and user-friendly in minimizing user intervention and providing a faithful rendition of protected sites.<br/><br/>For users, the project will make Web 2.0 applications safer and more reliable, without degrading the browsing experience. For developers, it will provide early error detection and the guarantee of safe execution for dynamic Web 2.0 applications.

Abstract: Millions of computers worldwide are estimated to be infected by malware (malicious software) and have become ? unknown to their owners ? part of an army of dangerous ?bots?, which are software applications that run automated tasks over the Internet controlled by cyber criminals. These infected computers are coordinated and used by attackers to launch illegal and destructive network activities including identity theft, sending spam (estimated 100 billion spam messages every day), launching distributed denial of service attacks, and committing click fraud. They are also capable of launching information warfare to destroy critical network infrastructure of a nation. Existing malware-detection approaches are limited in their ability to identify and discern malicious bots from legitimate and benign ones. This proliferation and sophistication requires constant vigilance and upgrading. The proposed project introduces a new and paradigm-shifting approach for malware detection, referred to as human-behavior driven malware detection. With this approach, the project will be able to accurately differentiate network behaviors of a legitimate user and malware by identifying and enforcing unique properties of human computer usage on a host.<br/><br/>The focus on human-user characteristics, versus those of malware, allows computer security to be realized without the need for continually monitoring ever-changing malware patterns. This approach will complement conventional malware-detecting techniques based on code analysis, data mining, or network trace filtering. The design of a unique and tamper-resistant traffic-enforcement framework will cryptographically verify the provenance information of both system and application-level data utilizing on-chip cryptographic hardware support. This project will implement novel and fine-grained input-traffic correlation analysis that has not been previously applied across a host?s network stack, kernel modules, and input devices. The proposed work will create new knowledge on design principles of reliable operating systems and applications, as well as gain insights to provide seamless integration of network-security techniques into a kernel. These studies will significantly advance the understanding of human-behavior based security and improve the system integrity of all networked computers. The research will build a base of important fundamental knowledge about user-centric security and will provide a compelling and more permanent solution to the increasing need of malware detection. The proposed work will focus on identifying characteristic human-user behaviors (namely application-level user inputs via keyboard and mouse), developing protocols for fine-grained traffic-input analysis, and preventing forgeries and attacks by malware. The PI will design and apply a combination of cryptographic techniques, correlation analysis, and Trusted Platform Module based integrity measures to carry out these tasks.<br/><br/>As an integrated component of the project, the PI will conduct outreach and educational activities that aim to increase the general awareness of cyber-security issues in the K-14 community and broaden the interdisciplinary participation of undergraduate and underrepresented groups in computer security research. In addition, the PI will develop a novel interactive software system Sec Ed for teaching computer security and advancing efforts in curriculum development, mentoring, diversity building, and workshop organization.

Abstract: Cyber security, like security in the physical world, relies upon investigation methodologies that piece together dispersed evidence spread across multiple places, and come to a conclusion on what security breaches have happened and how they happened. While effective evidential reasoning based on manual analysis are used in the physical world by law-enforcement agencies, in the cyber world we need automated reasoning methodologies to handle the automated cyber attacks against our nation's information infrastructures every day. This research aims at discovering and developing such automated reasoning methodologies. The problem is difficult due to the uncertain nature of such reasoning, which is compounded by the characteristics of cyber attacks.<br/><br/>The uncertainty in cyber security comes from two sources. The first is the uncertainty from not knowing the attacker's actions and choices. Since hackers are essentially invisible in the cyberworld, we have to rely upon various types of sensors that report symptoms of potential attacks. The second source of uncertainty comes from these sensors. Since in most cases the symptoms of cyber<br/>attacks significantly overlap with symptoms from benign network activities, it is not possible to rely on a single sensor to give an absolutely correct judgment on whether an attack has happened and succeeded. A key question is how to use these imperfect sensors to conduct reasoning so that one can come up with almost certain conclusions regarding a system's security status. <br/><br/>This challenge of reasoning under uncertainty is not new. In the past four decades computer science researchers have developed an array of reasoning models and methods for uncertainty, especially in the area of artificial intelligence. However, the emergence of cyber threats poses a new<br/>challenge to this problem. The existing methodologies typically require a knowledge-engineering process to build a knowledge model for the problem domain. This has worked reasonably well with the more static and well-behaved problem domains such as disease diagnosis. A key difference between these problem domains and cyber security is that the latter has to deal with an active<br/>malicious attacker who will try to break whatever assumptions made in the reasoning model. For this reason, the knowledge model for cyber security cannot be static because then they can be easily evaded. What will be an effective and practical knowledge engineering approach to handle the uncertainty in cyber security is the biggest open problem that needs to be answered from the<br/>research.<br/><br/>This research adopts an empirical, bottom-up approach to tackle the above challenges. Instead of starting from the existing theories, the PI will start from empirical study on how a human security analysts would reason about cyber events and try to capture the essence of the reasoning in the process. Then, the PI will carry out this empirical study by running intrusion detection sensors on production networks and work with system administrators to understand and reason about the alerts. The next step is to develop a reasoning model that simulates the human reasoning process, and apply the automated reasoning engine on fresh new data to see how it fares. In this spiral theory development process the PI can always make sure that the methodologies are applicable to real cyber-security analysis and constantly find gaps in the model that reveal what will be the most appropriate theories and how to apply them in this problem. The eventual goal is to find the right theoretical framework for reasoning under uncertainty in cyber-security, and validate such theories through repeatable experiments on data from production systems.<br/><br/>This research is tightly integrated into the PI?s education efforts both for students and targeted at the society at large. The empirical nature of the research provides a valuable venue for dialogue between security practitioners and researchers, which will result in a two-way education process: students working on the project can acquire the essential skills of applying advanced knowledge to a practical problem; and security practitioners like system administrators can learn the state-of-the art in cyber security technology through collaborative work with the research team. The empirical study carried out from the research will provide endless data and examples to refresh the materials of the cyber-security courses taught by the PI. New courses with a focus on uncertainty in cyber security defense will be developed. There will be a number of undergraduate students who take part in the research efforts, which will provide a unique education experience for them. Moreover, the test-bed infrastructure produced from the research will also be used as an education platform for the general public about cyber-security problems, with the help of the out-reach programs already established at Kansas State University.

Abstract: Sensor networks enable real-time gathering of large amounts of data that can be mined and analyzed for taking critical actions. As such, sensor networks are a key component of decision-making infrastructures. A critical issue in this context is the trustworthiness of the data being collected. Data integrity and quality decide the trustworthiness of data. Data integrity can be undermined not only because of errors by users, measurement devices and applications, but also because of malicious subjects who may inject inaccurate data with the goal of deceiving the data users. A fundamental tradeoff exists between data quality and the cost to gather and protect this data, e.g., in terms of sensor node energy. This project focuses on a multi-faceted solution to the problem of assessing integrity of data streams in sensor networks, taking into account cost and energy constraints. Key elements of the solution are: (a) a cyclic framework supporting the assessment of sensor data trustworthiness based on provenance, and sensor trustworthiness based on data that sensors provide; (b) strategies for continuously updating trust scores of sensor data and nodes; (c) a game-theoretic model to analyze and mitigate the risks due to active adversaries that try to undermine data integrity; (d) protocols for sensor network sleep/wake scheduling and routing that balance the data quality and energy efficiency tradeoff. The project also includes the development of tools for assessing data trustworthiness, and experimental evaluation of the system performance. The research has impact on healthcare, homeland security, and applications in several other domains.

Abstract: Wireless systems have become an inseparable part of our social fabric, which allow users to move around and access the services from different locations while on the move. However, wireless security is often cited as a major technical barrier that must be overcome before widespread adoption of mobile services can occur. Traditional approaches have focused on addressing security threats on a case-by-case basis in an ad-hoc manner as new and specialized threats are uncovered. Furthermore, as wireless networks become increasingly pervasive, the ubiquity of wireless is redefining security challenges (e.g., attacks can be conducted by new and rapidly evolving adversaries with little effort). <br/><br/>This project aims to build location-oriented information into any wireless network stack and serve as a promising new dimension across different layers to complement conventional security solutions and enhance wireless security. A suite of location-enabled techniques are integrated into wireless network stacks as a true partner to cope with attacks and collaboratively defend against adversaries. The solutions are developed generic enough to apply across heterogeneous mixes of wireless technologies through the interaction with industry collaborators. <br/><br/>Project results are expected to assist conventional security methods and advance our knowledge in exploring generic security approaches across a wide-range of wireless technologies, which will contribute significantly to the successful deployment and adoption of emerging wireless services. The project also strengthens the education and research of undergraduate and graduate students in related areas of wireless networks and security, and helps to prepare students to face the challenges of future information technology.

Abstract: Traditional security authorization decisions are black and white: a user either satisfies a particular access policy or does not. This rigidity is a handicap in our complex and unpredictable world. As a result, even security-conscious organizations typically grossly overprovision principals with access rights and/or underconstrain access policies to ensure that principals can always carry out the organization's mission effectively and respond to unexpected opportunities and challenges. This project focuses on developing dynamic and risk-aware approaches to access control that allow organizations to make security-critical decisions in the face of incomplete information and unexpected circumstances. This is accomplished by combining proof-theoretic access controls with economic models of risk. In the event that the expected proof of authorization for an action cannot be generated, the systems developed in this project carry out an efficient search for similar proofs of authorization that minimize the overall risk incurred by deviating from the expected. This approach allows policies to adapt dynamically to the changing context of the systems in which they are deployed. This research will have several benefits, including increased system availability during disasters or other uncommon cases not explicitly modeled by policies; reduced instances of permission creep, as overprovisioning users is no longer required to ensure that an organization's business needs are met; a quantifiable means of assessing how policies are actually used and how they might be changed to better reflect the evolution of organizations; and the development of metrics for assessing access control risks.

Abstract: The PI is developing bottom-up mechanisms for securing wireless networks against a class of "layer-violating" attacks. In a layer-violating attack, the attacker uses protocol behavior at one layer of the network stack to compromise a secure protocol at a different layer. Such layer-violating attacks often can span from the physical layer all the way to the transport layer. In the PI's approach, each layer interlocks with the higher layer, relying on the security properties guaranteed by the lower layer to provide security properties to the next higher layer, resulting in a protocol stack that is resilient to layer-violating attacks. The PI's efforts focus on four important security properties: availability against jamming, fairness, routing, and privacy. <br/><br/>The outcomes of this research will be: <br/>- A protocol stack secure against jamming at all layers, ensuring a specific level of performance despite the presence of an adversarial attacker <br/>- A protocol stack that provides fairness regardless of attacks at any layer, and specifies the types of fairness achievable against a cross-layer adversarial attacker <br/>- A results-oriented routing protocol that provides reliable performance assurances against attacks at any layer <br/>- A protocol stack that provides privacy across all layers of the network stack, ensuring minimal leakage of privacy-sensitive information.<br/><br/>The PI is also revising the introductory programming curriculum in the ECE department; one aspect of this revision is an emphasis on safe and secure code writing. The PI is also working to develop a middle-school-level curriculum to encourage underprivileged groups to pursue engineering education.

Abstract: Mobile handheld devices such as smartphones, PDAs, and smart media players have outpaced the growth of wired hosts, and are emerging as the predominant vehicle for Internet access. In recent years, newer mobile phones, including various versions from Apple, Google, Nokia, and others, have promoted greater programmability, radically changing the age-old model of mobile phones being a closed platform. However, openness arrives with new challenges of trustworthiness. The goal of this project is to improve the trustworthiness of mobile phones in their daily operations, by analyzing threats that occur either due to malware or due to regular applications, designing mitigation strategies, and evaluating developed solutions through a real deployment on a smartphone platform (Google Android) and operating in a real network (Sprint-Nextel).<br/><br/>This project will undertake crosscutting research, educational, and outreach plan to improve the robustness, reliability, security, privacy, and overall trustworthiness of mobile phones. The primary focus of this project will be on performance and security threats that are unique to mobile phones, including malicious applications that ex-filtrate data, performance loss due to resource constraints, privacy threats of lost devices, and remote network-based attacks. Specifically, this project will investigate issues related to following topics: (i) performance instability due to resource constraints (ii) protection against malicious applications (iii) privacy against lost phones (iv) detection and prevention against other network attacks. Techniques developed will have broad benefits to research and society. These techniques will enhance the trustworthiness of mobile phones, thereby improving the confidence of users in using these devices in their daily activities. An educational plan will introduce new curriculum centered on the mobile phone platform and establishes a new undergraduate laboratory for hands-on mobile device programming.
